<span class="subhead">PUCCINI, AND THE OPERA IN
GENERAL</span></h2>

<p>A big broad man, with a frank open countenance,
dark kindly eyes of a lazy lustrous depth, and a shy
retiring manner. Such is Giacomo Puccini, who is
operatically the man of the moment.</p>

<p>It was behind the scenes during the autumn season
of opera at Covent Garden in 1905 that I had the
privilege of first meeting and talking with him, and
about the last thing I could extract from him was
anything about his music. While his reserve comes
off like a mask when he is left to follow his own bent
in conversation, one can readily understand why he
adheres, and always has done, to his rule of never
conducting his own works.</p>

<p>One thing struck me as peculiarly characteristic
about his nature and personality. The success of
<i class="opus">Madama Butterfly</i>&mdash;for that was the work in progress
on the stage as we passed out by way of the
"wings" to the front of the house&mdash;was at the moment
the talk of the town. Puccini was full, not of the
success of his opera, but of the achievements of
the artists who were interpreting it. "Isn't Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
So-and-so fine?" "Doesn't Signor So-and-so conduct
admirably?" "Isn't it beautifully put on?" The
composer was content and happy to sink into the
background and think, in the triumph, of all he owed to
those who were carrying out his ideas. He has a quiet
sense of fun, too. "Let us step quietly," he said&mdash;as
we came into the range of the scene that was being
enacted&mdash;"like butterflies."</p>

<p>I have called Puccini the operatic man of the moment.
It is not difficult to account for his popularity. His
whole-souled devotion to this one form of musical art,
in which he has certainly achieved much, has by some
been pointed to as defining his limits. Apart from a
few early string quartets, which mean nothing more
than the usual preliminary studies of a gifted student,
Puccini has written absolutely nothing but operas
since he started. In this respect his music has a
certain well-defined natural characteristic that gives
him&mdash;if it be necessary in these days to fit any particular
composer into his own special niche&mdash;a distinct
place in the history of the progress and development of
the art and science of music making.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, the opera had its beginnings in
the dance, but almost at the same time it travelled
along the road of the development of vocal expression
by music. As early as the days of Peri and Caccini,
who reverted to the old Greek drama as the basis on
which to build something anew, and by so doing
brought forth the germ which was afterwards to bear
fruit through Gluck and Wagner, the feeling for
freedom of expression, the desire to snatch music away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
from the tyranny of a set form&mdash;counterpoint, as it was
then understood&mdash;strove to make itself felt and understood.
It must not be taken to mean that the old
contrapuntists did not endeavour to combine the
adherence to a form with some degree of definite
expression; for in the works of one of the greatest of
this school, old Josquin des Près, are to be found
plenty of emotional touches by which, even in so
restricted a pattern as the madrigal form, it was plain
that a closer union between words and music&mdash;an
emotional feeling, in short&mdash;was clearly the thing
striven for.</p>

<p>Still dealing briefly with beginnings, one may point
to the dramatic cantatas&mdash;particularly in Italy, but
found in France as well&mdash;or madrigal plays, by which,
in distinction to what may be called little comedies
with music, this essential "operatic" feature in the
union of the arts of speech and song, comes out with
special clearness.</p>

<p>In Italy then, the land which owns Puccini as one
of its most distinguished sons, the opera had its rise;
and in <i class="opus">Dafne</i>, the first child of a new art, it is curious
to note, it immediately turned aside into one of those
many by-paths which led it very far away from the
goal of its promise. Curious again is the reason for
its first fall&mdash;the desire of the leading singer for vocal
display, and the introduction of long vocal flourishes,
which, having nothing to do with the case, yet pleased
the public mightily. In this <i class="opus">Dafne</i>&mdash;the score of
which has been lost&mdash;it was the great singer Archilei
who was the offender. Yet again a strange thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
comes down to us after these many years. Peri, the
composer, was highly delighted with the interpolations
and the vocal gymnastics.</p>

<p>But out of something dead, something very much
alive was destined to develop. The old Greek drama
was not to be resuscitated by a sort of transfusion of
blood&mdash;music, the newest and most emotional of the
arts, being the medium to carry life into the structure.
There is not space here to do more than hint at the
various fresh phases&mdash;the reforms, as they have been
called&mdash;each of which, in trying to deal with what was
already built up, really brought to an achievement the
ideal which had floated before many a worker in the
same field.</p>

<p>In Italy, as early as Cimarosa's day&mdash;he died in
1801&mdash;the opera, regarded purely as a musical form,
attained as near perfection as possible. It is difficult,
even when dealing with a period that, unlike our own,
was very much more concerned about the manner
than the matter of things, to distinguish between the
various styles of opera; but taking the opera seria and
the opera buffa as representing two great phases of the
art, Cimarosa stands out as one who combined the
essential qualities of both into products which had the
stamp of individuality. Pergolesi is another shining
light who stands out in the long line of illustrious
workers whose efforts were entirely cast into the shade
by the arrival of Rossini and his followers, Donizetti
and Bellini. All this time, during which so-called
Italian opera dominated the whole of Europe, nothing
was done in Italy in the way of developing orchestral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
writing, which in Germany had made such marvellous
strides. At the psychological moment&mdash;for Italy&mdash;came
Verdi, who, if he took the opera very much as he found
it, breathed from the very first a new spirit into its
composition. His artistic growth, as seen by his later
operas, was one of the most remarkable things in
modern musical history. And in the fulness of time
we come to Puccini, to whom it is reasonable to point
as the successor of Verdi. These two, who may be
linked up with reason with Boïto and Ponchielli, present
many features of resemblance. Puccini's musical expression,
at first purely vocal, has in his later work
shown that same growth in artistic development.
From the beginning he was concerned with the continuous
flow of melody, since he had not, like Verdi, to
get away exactly from the old form of the set numbers;
but in Puccini's case, the growth referred to is seen
in his latest work in the further elaboration of the
orchestral portion. Although in England we have
had few experiments worked out in the way of the
development of opera, it is safe to say that such new
modern works as have been taken to our hearts have
owed not a little to the orchestral part of the fabric.
Tchaikovsky's <i class="opus">Eugen Oniegin</i> and Humperdinck's <i class="opus">Hänsel
und Gretel</i> are at least two notable cases in point.</p>

<p>But in whatever way we view an opera, mere
orchestral fulness will not serve to land the work very
high up in the esteem of music lovers. Nor will the
purely beautiful in music&mdash;melody worked out with
transparent clearness of form&mdash;save a poor, unconvincing
or uninteresting dramatic fabric from passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
into the great storehouse of the unacted. Puccini's
music is dramatic, and by far the greater part of it, by
a sort of quick natural instinct, is purely of the theatre.
His first and most direct appeal is by the charm and
vitality of the vocal expression, while his whole plan
is one of movement. From the first&mdash;if we except for
the moment his <i class="opus">Le Villi</i>, which was first called a ballet-opera&mdash;he
called his operas <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Dramma per lyrica</i>&mdash;lyric
dramas, a term first established, and moulded into a
definite art-form, by Wagner. With his first opera,
Puccini started something of a new form in the short
opera; and two remarkable works of the kind in
<i class="opus">Cavalleria Rusticana</i> by Mascagni and <i class="opus">I Pagliacci</i>
by Leoncavallo, which came very soon after, clearly
indicate that he had founded a school as it were; and
so from Italy to-day, as in times past, this particular
fashion spread to other countries. Puccini, still
exhibiting, with a strong and in many ways typical
national feeling, spontaneous vocal melody as his
leading characteristic, did not limit himself to the
perfection of the short opera. His subsequent works
were of larger calibre. He left the fanciful and
imaginative and the old world legends, and turned to
everyday life for his subjects. In general form&mdash;for
one must revert to this not particularly lucid description
when dealing with opera&mdash;Puccini must be placed
among the shining lights who have chosen to deal
with what may be called light opera. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Opéra comique</i>,
as translated by our term "comic opera," means something
so entirely different, that although "light opera"
is but a poor expression, it is one that may perhaps
be most readily "understanded of the people."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
The term "light" is associated practically entirely
with the music. The subjects of Puccini's operas are
all of them tragic, but the expression of the theme, the
working out along the already roughly defined paths,
is not by the heavy, the big, or the strongly moving in
music. One may point almost to Bizet, as shown in
<i class="opus">Carmen</i>, as the special point from which Puccini started.
Furthermore, Puccini stands almost unrivalled in his
own particular way in giving us, by means of operatic
music, something very near akin to the comedy of
manners in drama. Much might with advantage be
deduced from the success of Puccini in this country,
and the same result applied to the question of our
national opera; or, seeing that such a thing does not
exist, to the crying need for some encouragement to
be given to native composers. Puccini, it may be, has
become the vogue simply because he is light and lyrical,
not so much here in the dramatic, but in the musical
sense. No one, it is safe to say, at this time of day
desires to go back in any shape or form to the old
"set-number" sort of piece. Such a reversion may
fittingly form the ideal towards which a follower of
Sullivan&mdash;who in his <i class="opus">Yeomen of the Guard</i> gave us
unquestionably the best definite "light" opera of the
last generation&mdash;may strive to bring to perfection.
Puccini has by the general mould of his work made
his place and found his following on the operatic
stage, and it is surely by the vocal strength and vocal
continuity of his work that this place of his has been
achieved and maintained. It is easy, of course, to
point to the simplicity of the achievement when one
sees the fruit of the labour: but without urging any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
to copy an accepted model, or to merely repeat what
has been already designed, one may wonder why, with
so many gifted melodists among contemporary British
musicians, no one has given us definite light opera.
It is a direction in which our composers have never
moved. If a reason for Puccini's greatness&mdash;or
popularity, if you will&mdash;is wanted, it may be found in
this extremely clever use of the light lyrical style.
And lest there be any misunderstanding, let it be
said that hardly one of Puccini's songs or dramatic
numbers can be pointed to as making this or that opera
an accepted favourite. "Che gelida manina" from
<i class="opus">La Bohème</i> is trotted out by not a few budding tenors,
and it may be occasionally heard at a ballad concert,
but even this is not sung one-tenth as many times as,
say, the prologue to <i class="opus">I Pagliacci</i>, leaving out of the
question the extreme popularity, as an instrumental
piece, of the Intermezzo from <i class="opus">Cavalleria</i>. Puccini's
melodies, if they do not actually fall to pieces away
from their surroundings, at least very quickly lose
their full significance, and not a little of their charm.
And it is for this reason, therefore, that Puccini stands
as the most definitely operatic composer of the moment.
He has had great opportunities, it is true, but he has
had great struggles. Like Wagner, he is concerned,
and ever has been, with just one phase of art. To those
that come after may be left the task of deciding as to
his exact place in the roll of fame. By the oneness of
his endeavour, by the sincerity of his expression, by
the spontaneity of his vocal melody, does Puccini stand
worthily among the living masters of music.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II">II</a><br />

<span class="subhead">PUCCINI'S EARLY LIFE</span></h2>

<p>In Lucca in 1858, in a house in the Via Poggia, Giacomo
Puccini was born. The family originally came from
Celle, a typical mountain village on the right bank of
the Serchio. From the earliest times the family was
one devoted to the art of music, and while the world
knows only of the musician who is the subject of this
book, the achievements of his musical ancestors were
of no mean order.</p>

<p>It will be sufficient to trace back the family to one of
the same name, a Giacomo Puccini, who, born in 1712,
studied with Caretti at Bologna. During his student
days he was the friend of Martini, and thus from very
early days the Puccini family have had intimate
connection with those musicians whose names will
live as long as musical history. On returning to
Lucca this Puccini was appointed organist of the
cathedral and subsequently <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">maestro di capella</i>. His
compositions were entirely in the domain of ecclesiastical
music, and include a motet, a Te Deum, and
some services.</p>

<p>His son, Antonio, also proceeded to Bologna for his
musical training, and in process of time succeeded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
the post at Lucca. Antonio's chief composition was a
Requiem Mass, which was sung at Lucca on the
occasion of the funeral of Joseph II. of Tuscany.</p>

<p>The first of the family to turn his attention to
opera was Domenico Puccini, the son of the foregoing,
who, like his father and grandfather, after studying at
Bologna, and under the famous Paisiello at Naples,
also held the post at Lucca. Of his several operas,
<i class="opus">Quinto Fabio</i>, <i class="opus">Il Ciarlatano</i>, and <i class="opus">La Moglie Capricciosa</i>
had a certain vogue in his day, but have passed into
oblivion. Dying at the age of forty-four, he left four
children, of whom Michele was the father of the
Puccini with whom we are dealing.</p>

<p>The grandfather Antonio helped this young Michele
and sent him to study at Bologna, where he came
under the influence of Stanislaus Mattei, the teacher
of Rossini. Later on he proceeded to Naples, where
he was taught by Mercadente and Donizetti. Returning
to Lucca he married Albina Magi, and was
appointed Inspector of the then newly formed Institute
of Music. Some masses and an opera, <i class="opus">Marco
Foscarini</i>, stand to his credit, but it was as a teacher
that this Puccini did his best work. Among his pupils
were Carlo Angeloni and Vianesi, who afterwards
won distinction as a conductor, not only in Italy but
at Paris and Marseilles.</p>

<p>Michele Puccini died at the age of fifty-one in 1864,
leaving his wife, who was then thirty-three, to provide
and care for his seven children. It is interesting to
record that the famous Pacini, the composer of <i class="opus">Saffo</i>,
which is still regarded as perhaps the chief classic of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the purely Italian school, conducted the Requiem sung
at his funeral.</p>

<p>Puccini's mother and her noble work in bringing up
her large family&mdash;for she was left with no great share
of this world's goods&mdash;deserves infinitely more than
this bare mention of her excellence. In the present
instance, it is her patient care in making her fifth
child, our Giacomo Puccini, a musician, that we have
to recognise. But for this patience, the way of the
man who was destined to achieve his own place in the
annals of fame must have been still more rough. All
praise then to the patient mother whose memory is
still so lovingly cherished by her distinguished son.</p>

<p>Giacomo Puccini was only six when his father died,
and as a child was remarkable for a restless nature
and a keen desire to travel. He was sent to school at
the seminary of S. Michele, and afterwards to San
Martino. Arithmetic appears to have been his chief
stumbling-block, but in everything, his curious irresponsible
nature, his strong dislike to anything like
guidance and restraint, made the acquisition of knowledge
a hard task. Failing to acquire any sort of
distinction in any branch of scholarship, an uncle of
his, on his mother's side, tried to make him a singer;
but the future musician, whose triumph was gained,
curiously enough, in the display of the very art he
despised, added, in this particular subject, one more
to his many failures. The mother, in spite, doubtless,
of a good deal of well-meant advice as to wasting time
and money on a singularly unpromising youth, stuck
to her conviction that Giacomo was destined by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
gifts to carry on the long line of family musicians;
and with many real sacrifices in the way of pinching
and scraping, sent him to Lucca, where, at the Institute
of Music, founded by Pacini, he came first under the
influence of Angeloni, who, it will be remembered, was
a pupil of his father. Infinite patience seems to have
been the chief quality possessed by Angeloni, and by
dint of great tact and sympathy, he infused an interest
and something of a passion for music into his wayward
young pupil. Giacomo became a fair player, and was
sent off to take charge of the music at the church of
Muligliano, a little village three miles from Lucca, and
in a short time he had the church of S. Pietro at
Somaldi added to his responsibilities. It was during
the exercise of his church duties that the spirit of
composition seems to have descended upon him, and
certainly, if not in actually a novel way, a rather disconcerting
one. During the offertory, and at other
places in the Mass, it was the custom of the organist
to improvise a more or less extended <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pièce d'occasion</i>, a
custom which still obtains. The officiating priests
were more than occasionally startled by hearing, mixed
up with these spirited improvisations of their young
organist, certain plainly recognisable themes from
operas, old and new.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 287px;"><img class="nobdr" id="i12" src="images/i027.jpg" width="287" height="357" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">CHURCH OF S. PIETRO, SOMALDI, WHERE PUCCINI WAS ORGANIST</div></div>

<p>There is no definite record of any specific continuation
of studies while Puccini was contributing in a
questionable way to the dignity of the church's service;
but in 1877 there was an exhibition at Lucca, and a
musical competition was announced, a setting of a
cantata <i class="opus">Juno</i>, and young Puccini entered. As happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
with Berlioz, so too the young composer's work
was rejected, as not conforming in any way with the
accepted canons of the art of music. Puccini at this
point gave an early indication of that doggedness of
purpose, a quiet pursuance of his own aims and working
out his own ideas, which marked his later career, and
which must have come as rather a surprise to his
family, who regarded him in all probability as a lazy
wayward youth. He did not take the refusal of the
Lucca authorities to accept his work the least to heart,
but arranged for a performance of it, and the public
found it very much to their taste. About this time
another early composition, a motet for the feast of San
Paolina, was performed. With these successes, Lucca
and its restricted area, with the evidently uncongenial
work of a church organist, soon became entirely distasteful
to him, and after hearing Verdi's <i class="opus">Aïda</i> at the
theatre, his mind was made up. To Milan, the Mecca
of the young Italian musician, he must go.</p>

<p>His mother still was his best friend; and although
the cost of living and studying in Milan was sufficient
to daunt the courage of any one far less hampered with
domestic difficulties than she was, she bravely set about
making the necessary sacrifices. Through a friend at
Court, the Marchioness Viola-Marina, she enlisted the
kindly sympathy of Queen Margherita, who generously
agreed to be responsible for the expense of one of the
necessary three years, while an uncle of hers came to
her assistance by defraying the cost of the other two.</p>

<p>The Conservatory of Music at Milan is best known
perhaps from the fact that the great teacher of singing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Lamperti, whose pupils number Albani and Sembrich,
was a professor there up to the date of his retirement,
in 1875. With the Royal College at Naples it represents
at the present day the only survival of the most
ancient teaching schools which began to be founded in
Italy at the end of the fifteenth century, the name
Conservatorio being given to the union of music
schools for the preservation of the art and science of
music. The oldest of them were the four schools at
Naples, all of which were attached to monastical
foundations, and which had their rise in the schools
founded by the Fleming, Tinctor. There were four
other schools, similar as to their foundation, at Venice,
the origin of which was due to another great Fleming,
Willaert.</p>

<p>On reaching Milan, Puccini's first thought was to
bring himself earnestly to study, and to pass the
necessary examination for entrance into this "Reale
Conservatorio de Musica." Apart from his steady
determination to mend his haphazard ways, it is good
to note that his good resolutions were put to the test,
for he does not appear to have succeeded at the first
trial. But he had grit in him, and he stuck to his work
bravely; and in 1880, towards the end of October, he
passed his entrance examination with flying colours,
coming out with top marks over all the competitors.
His actual work as a student did not begin till
December 16 of that year, and we get from an
interesting letter to his mother a vivid picture of his
doings at this time. Bazzini, the master with whom
he was put to study, will be remembered as the composer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
of that favourite violin piece with virtuosi,
the <i class="opus">Witches' Dance</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mamma</span>,&mdash;On Thursday, at eleven o'clock, I
had my second lesson from Bazzini, and I am getting on
very well. To-morrow I start my theory lessons. My
daily life is very simple. I get up at 8.30, and when I
do not go to the school I stay indoors and play the
pianoforte. For this I am trying now a new technical
method by Angeloni, which is very simple.</p>

<p>"At 10.30 I have my lunch, and a short walk afterwards.
At one I return home and study Bazzini's
lesson for a couple of hours; after that from three to
five I go to the piano again and play some classic. I
have been playing through Boïto's <i class="opus">Mefistofele</i>, a kind
friend having given me the vocal score. On! how I
wish I had money enough to buy all the music I want
to get!</p>

<p>"Five is dinner time, and it is a very frugal meal&mdash;soup,
cheese, and half a litre of wine. As soon as it
is over I go out for a walk and stroll up and down
the Galleria. Now comes the end of the chapter&mdash;bed!"</p>

<p>All through the three years of his sojourn at Milan,
Puccini, from the evidence of his letters which he sent
home, seems to have preserved the simplicity of his
nature, and to have kept in a remarkable way to his
good resolutions. For composition he was put, shortly
after his entrance, with Ponchielli, the composer of
<i class="opus">La Gioconda</i>. For both his teachers Puccini had the
liveliest admiration, and the following extract from
another of his characteristic letters to his mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
towards the end of his student days, showed how
lively an interest Ponchielli took in his <span class="locked">future:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"To-morrow I have to go to Ponchielli. I have already
seen him this morning, but we have had little opportunity
of talking about what I am to do in the future,
as his wife was with him. However, he promised to
mention me to Ricordi, and he assures me that in my
examinations I have made a favourable impression. I
am now working hard at my exercise, towards the
completion of which I have made good progress."</p>

<p>This exercise Puccini speaks of was the equivalent
to the composition demanded by our Universities before
a student passes to the degree of Bachelor of
Music. With this <i class="opus">Capriccio Sinfonica</i> Puccini made
his first mark as a rising composer. It was not
apparently an entirely spontaneous outpouring, for
he wrote it on all sorts of odd scraps of paper, just as
the mood took him. It is curious to note that although
in his general character he had made a radical change
from waywardness to a steady determination and
purposeful endeavour towards one definite goal, his
methods of work and his music writing remained, to
this day in fact, as very typical of the carelessness of
the artistic temperament. His scores were, and still
are, exceedingly difficult to decipher. Both Bazzini
and Ponchielli were much attached to the promising
young musician, but his handwriting&mdash;more particularly
his way of setting down notes on paper&mdash;was more
than once a great trial to their patience. Bazzini on
one occasion inquired about this final exercise, and
Ponchielli replied: "I really cannot tell you anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
yet about it. Puccini brings me every lesson such a
vile scrawl, that I confess, up to the present, I do no
more than stare at it in despair."</p>

<p>When Ponchielli came to sit down and study the
score of this Capriccio, the black-beetle-like splotches
on the untidy manuscript did not prevent the worth of
the music from coming through and making its appeal
to the kindly teacher's mind. Both Bazzini and he
were struck by its freedom, its freshness, its general
grip of the orchestra. It was performed at one of the
Conservatory concerts, and Puccini's fame, heralded
by the critic Filippi, who wrote in a special article
in the <i class="opus">Perseveranza</i> about the first performance,
travelled round Milan. It is interesting to read what
Filippi said about the first serious work by the future
hope, operatically speaking, of young Italy:</p>

<p>"Puccini has decidedly a musical temperament,
especially as a symphonist, having unity of style and
personality of character. There are more of such
qualities in this Capriccio than are found in most
composers of to-day, thorough grasp of style, a quick
sense of colour, an inventive genius. The ideas are
bright, strong, effective. He is not concerned with
uncertainties, but fills up his scheme with harmonic
boldness, and knits the whole together logically and
with perfect order."</p>

<p>This discerning writer goes on to speak of the
skilful way in which the melodic material is worked
up, and the general feeling for movement, states that
it called forth the warmest enthusiasm, and dubs it by
far the most promising work of that year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Faccio, a well-known conductor, made arrangements
to have it played at an orchestral concert, and Puccini
wrote with joy and alacrity to his mother to arrange to
have the parts copied, asking to have sent to him,
without a moment's delay, twelve first violin parts, ten
seconds, nine violas, eight cellos, and seven basses.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 253px;"><img class="nobdr" id="i18" src="images/i035.jpg" width="253" height="246" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">PUCCINI AND FONTANA, THE LIBRETTIST, AT THE TIME OF THE PRODUCTION' OF "LE VILLI," 1884</div></div>

<p>Flushed with his first real success Puccini was ready
to act upon any suggestion that would enable him to
keep the ball, once started, rolling along merrily.
Ponchielli was struck with the essentially dramatic
quality of Puccini's mind and bent, and promised to
find him a suitable libretto so that he might start on
an opera. He invited Puccini to spend a few days at
his country villa at Caprino, and there Puccini met
Fontana, who, like himself, was at the beginning of his
career. After much cogitation, it was decided to
collaborate in a short work, so that it might be ready
for the Sozogno competition, the limit of time for that
event having nearly expired. Thus it was that Fate,
or Chance, settled the form in which, as it subsequently
transpired, Puccini was from the very beginning to
appear as a setter of fashion in opera. But, as we
shall see, the path to fame did not immediately open to
Puccini. The Sozogno prize was not won, but <i class="opus">Le
Villi</i>, his first opera, was born, and, like Wagner, the
ardent and now well-equipped young composer began
to experience those pains and penalties, and bravely
ploughed his way through thorns and over the rough
places, and finally conquered by the sheer force of
perseverance, endurance, and singleness of aim.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE PUCCINI OF YESTERDAY
AND TO-DAY</span></h2>

<p>Puccini, after the death of his beloved mother, sought
consolation in hard work, and <i class="opus">Edgar</i> was written in
Milan during a period, which was in like manner
experienced by Wagner, of additional anxiety, brought
about by the want of the actual means to live. But it
is undoubtedly that out of such trials and troubles the
best work of the brain is forged and brought to an
achievement.</p>

<p>Puccini was living at this time in a poor quarter of
Milan with his brother and another student. With the
£80 he received for <i class="opus">Le Villi</i> he paid away nearly half of
it to the restaurant keeper who had allowed him credit.</p>

<p>Milan, the chief operatic centre of opera-loving
Italy, is full of music schools, agencies, restaurants
and cafés, whose reason for existence, practically,
is found in the fact that half the population is
in one way or another connected with the operatic
stage. Milan is even more Bohemian than Paris
in this respect, and it is not difficult to understand
why the subject of unconventionality, as treated
by Puccini in <i class="opus">La Bohème</i>, should have come to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
with such force. He had, in fact, gone through
the whole thing completely, so far as living on nothing
and making all sorts of shifts for existence were concerned.
Milan's social atmosphere is almost completely
that of theatrical Bohemianism, and all the students
come very intimately into contact with its essence and
spirit.</p>

<p>There are many little stories of Puccini in his early days,
which, after all, only represent the common lot of many a
struggling genius the wide world over. He and his companions
at the time <i class="opus">Edgar</i> was in the process of making
rented one little top room in the Via Solferino, for
which, according to Puccini's friend Eugenio Checchi,
who has recorded the history of these early days,
they paid twenty-four shillings a month. Puccini kept
a diary, which he called "Bohemian Life," in 1881.
It was little more than a register of expenses. Coffee,
bread, tobacco and milk appear to be the chief entries,
and there is an entire absence of anything more substantial
in the way of food. In one place there was a
herring put down; and on this being brought to
Puccini's recollection, he laughingly said: "Oh, yes,
I remember. That was a supper for four people."</p>

<p>As will be seen in the chapter on <i class="opus">La Bohème</i>, this
incident was made use of by the librettists in the third
act of that opera.</p>

<p>From the Congregation of Charity at Rome, Puccini
was in receipt at this time of £4 per month. The sum
used to come in a registered letter on a certain day,
and he and his companions usually had to suffer the
landlord to open it and deduct, first, his share for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
rent. Many were the scenes they had with this worthy
possessor of real estate. He had forbidden them to
cook in the room, and even with the marvellously
cheap restaurants, where at least the one national
dish of spaghetti could be indulged in for the merest
trifle, our group of young strugglers found it even cheaper
to do their cooking at home. As the hour of a meal
drew near, the landlord used to go into the next room,
or prowl about the landing, to listen and to smell.
The usual stratagem was to place the spirit lamp on
the table and over it a dish in which to cook eggs.
When the frizzling began, the others would call out to
Puccini to play "like the very devil," and going over
to the piano he would start on some wild strains which
stopped when the modest omelette&mdash;two eggs between
three&mdash;was ready to turn out.</p>

<p>The material for firing was another source of
expense. Their modest order did not warrant the
coal-merchant sending up five flights of stairs to
deliver it in whatever receptacle took the place of the
usual cellar: so Michael Puccini, the brother, used to
dress up in his best clothes, including a valuable
relic in the shape of a "pot-hat," and take with him a
black-bag. The others said, "Good-bye, bon voyage,"
with some effusion on the door-step to let the neighbours
imagine he was going away for a visit; and off
Michael would go, to return in the dusk with the bag
full of coal.</p>

<p>There is something infinitely pathetic in recording
that Puccini, when fortune smiled upon him, wrote to
this brother in great glee to tell him of the success of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
<i class="opus">Manon</i>, and to say that he was able to buy the house
in Lucca where they were born. But Michael, who
had departed to South America to mend his own
fortunes, was then lying dead of yellow fever, to
which he had succumbed after three days' illness.</p>

<p><i class="opus">Edgar</i> being completed, the work brought him in
about six times the amount he had obtained for <i class="opus">Le
Villi</i>, while with <i class="opus">Manon</i>, which followed, his position
became practically assured for the future. Always of
a shy, retiring disposition, he had often longed to
get away from the cramped conditions of town life,
and Torre del Lago, on a secluded lake not far from
Lucca, lying in beautiful country, surrounded by woods,
and connected by canals with the sea&mdash;into which it
flows just by the spot where Shelley's body was
washed ashore and afterwards burned&mdash;was an ideal
spot to which his thoughts had often turned. He went
there to reside first in 1891, about the time he was
writing <i class="opus">La Bohème</i>; but some time before that he had
found a partner of his joys in Elvira Bonturi, who,
like himself, came from Lucca, and whom he married.
Their only son, Antonio, was born in the December of
1886. It was not until 1900 that Puccini built the
delightful villa at Torre del Lago to which he is so
devotedly attached, and to which he always refers as
a Paradise.</p>

<p>Before finally deciding on a site at Torre del Lago&mdash;the
Tower of the Lake&mdash;Puccini stayed for a time
at Castellaccio, near Pescia, where a good deal of
<i class="opus">La Bohème</i> was put to paper. <i class="opus">Tosca</i> was begun at
Torre del Lago, and finished during a visit at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
country house, Monsagrati, not far from Lucca, of his
friend the Marquis Mansi. At the time of <i class="opus">Madama
Butterfly</i> he was back at Torre del Lago, to which he
was taken after his motor accident, but he was at this
time the possessor of another country villa at Abetone,
in the Tuscan Appenines, and in this latter place a
good deal of his latest opera was set down. He has
more recently built yet another country villa on the
opposite side of the lake to Torre del Lago, on
the Chiatri Hill. It is a charming example of the
Florentine style of architecture, in which brick and
marble are most skilfully blended. But Puccini told
me, when last I saw him, that so far he had only
spent a week-end in it.</p>

<p>Puccini, who was always addicted to sport and an
open-air life, went in for motoring in the year 1901.
His accident, by which he broke his leg and suffered a
great deal of pain and anxiety owing to the difficulty of
the uniting of the bone, took place in the February of
1903. He had left his beloved Torre del Lago and
gone into Lucca for a change of air and place, owing
to a bad cold and sore throat from which he could
not get free. One of Puccini's characteristics is a
certain obstinacy which very often leads him to do
things in direct opposition to anything like a command.
The fact that his doctor had told him not to go out
in his car at night was sufficient, of course, for
"Mr. James"&mdash;Puccini is invariably addressed by
those round him as "Sor Giacomo"&mdash;to decide on a
little evening trip; and he and his wife and son with
the chauffeur started off in the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
About five miles from Lucca there is a little place
called Vignola, where is a sharp turn in the road by a
bridge. Going at full speed, this was not noticed in
the dark, and as the car turned, it went over an
embankment and fell nearly thirty feet into a field.
Mdme. Puccini and Antonio were unhurt, but the
chauffeur had a fractured thigh and Puccini a fractured
leg. Unfortunately, Puccini was pinned under the
car, stunned and bruised by the fall; and, moreover,
suffered considerably from the fumes of the petrol.
A doctor, luckily, was staying at a cottage near by,
and he was able to render first aid. Afterwards
another doctor was sent for from Lucca, and it was
decided to make a litter and carry Puccini to Torre
del Lago by boat, as owing to the inflammation the
leg was not able to be set immediately. Puccini's
great friend, Marquis Ginori, went with him on the
boat; and, although in great pain, the invalid found
himself regretting that on the journey so many wild
duck flew within range, just at the time, as he laughingly
remarked, he could not shoot them. Three days
after his arrival home, Colzi, a famous specialist
from Florence, came and set the leg. The actual
uniting of the bone was a long and tedious process,
which spread over eight months, and Puccini was not
really able to walk again properly until he had been to
Paris&mdash;where his <i class="opus">Tosca</i> was produced at the Opera
Comique&mdash;and undergone a special treatment at the
hands of a French specialist. His first visit to Paris
had been in 1898 for the rehearsals of <i class="opus">La Bohème</i>.</p>

<p><i class="cite">Photo. by R. de Guili &amp; Co., Lucca</i></p></div></div>

<p>Puccini visited London for the first time when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
came over for the production of <i class="opus">Manon</i> at Covent
Garden in 1894. He came again in 1897 for the production
in English of <i class="opus">La Bohème</i> at Manchester by the
Carl Rosa Company. This was not, by all accounts,
one of his most pleasant visits to a country of which he
is very fond. Apart from the nervous worry of a first
performance of a brand new work in a strange
language, there were difficulties which made it a
peculiarly trying time for the composer. Robert
Cuningham, the Rodolfo, was unfortunately seized
with a fearful cold which made him practically speechless
on the night of the performance, and he could do
no more than whisper his part. All things considered,
it is not to be wondered at that Puccini, after spending
nearly three weeks in rehearsal, decided to keep away
from the theatre on the eventful night. He has himself
written down his impressions of Manchester, as
well as those of London and Paris.</p>

<p>"Manchester, land of the smoke, cold, fog, rain and&mdash;cotton!</p>

<p>"London has six million inhabitants, a movement
which it is as impossible to describe as the language is
to acquire. A city of splendid women, beautiful amusements,
and altogether fascinating.</p>

<p>"In Paris, the gay city, there is less traffic than in
London, but life there flies. My chief friends were
Zola, Sardou and Daudet."</p>

<p>It was when Puccini was in Paris for the production
of <i class="opus">La Bohème</i> that he first met Sardou and arranged
about the setting of <i class="opus">La Tosca</i>. Sardou invited him to
dinner, and after the coffee and cigars asked him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
play a little of the music he thought of putting in the
new opera. Sardou's knowledge of music, by the way,
has, to say the least of it, its limitations, and Puccini
is very loth to play anything he may have in his mind
in the way of a composition. Puccini sat down at the
piano, however, and played a good deal, which Sardou
liked immensely. But Sardou did not know that the
composer was merely stringing together all sorts of
odd airs out of his previous operas.</p>

<p>Puccini's days at his beloved Torre del Lago are
divided between sport and work. The beginning of
his house, by the way, was a keeper's lodge, a mere
hut, on the edge of the wood. It is so white that in
the distance it looks like marble, but as a building it is
quite unpretentious. There is a little garden leading
down to the lake, while at the back stretches the fine
open country. He is usually up and away early in the
morning, accompanied by his two favourite dogs,
"Lea" and "Scarpia." He goes to and fro from his
shoots in his motor-boat "Butterfly." The place
abounds with wild duck, wild swans and all sorts of
water-fowl, the principal quarry from the sportsman's
point of view being coots, hares, and wild boar.
Puccini has been frequently snowed up while away
shooting as late as April.</p>

<p>To the south of the lake, in the plain, are some
remains of a bath attributed to Nero, with undoubted
traces of a Roman road and a fosse. One can hardly
move a yard in Italy without coming across villas of
Lucullus, roads of Hannibal, or fields of Cataline, but
this particular place, not only from the traces of buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
which remain, but from the result of excavation,
by which many Roman remains were brought to light,
is of great antiquity.</p>

<p>Coming in from a "shoot" Puccini often allows the
best part of the day to pass in more or less what seems
like idleness, preferring to put down his music at night&mdash;the
one relic, one may say, of his old wayward restless
ways. He works chiefly on the ground floor of his
house at Torre del Lago, in a spacious apartment
which is a sort of dining-room, study and music-room
all in one. The ceiling is crossed with large wooden
beams, and he calls the Venetian blinds, which are
outside the many and large windows, "mutes" for the
sun, using the word, of course, in its sense of a device
for softening the tone of a musical instrument. The
walls of the room are decorated with some quick
impulsive designs, dashed on by his friend the artist
Nomellini, representing the flight of the hours from
dawn to night. For the rest, the room is full of
photographs of all sorts of distinguished people, from
Verdi downwards, and stuffed birds.</p>

<p>When the desire for work is upon Puccini, "it
catches him," as an Italian would say, "by the scalp,"
and he works at a thing continuously. During the
recovery from his motor accident he was wheeled to
the piano each day and planned out <i class="opus">Madama Butterfly</i>,
although the actual writing down of the melodies and
the general work of construction was done, of course,
away from the instrument. He makes a rough sketch
of the whole score as a rule, which he subjects to all
sorts of weird alterations only intelligible to himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
and from this makes a clean copy embodying all the
process of polishing and finishing to which the original
idea was subjected.</p>

<p><i class="cite">Photo. by S. Ernesto Arboco</i></p></div></div>

<p>It is difficult to get from Puccini any particulars of
his ideas and aims. He much prefers to do things
rather than to talk about them. He has on one or
two occasions, however, given a hint of his views
which may be worth putting down again. One is
on the interesting question as to dramatic instinct in
music. Puccini maintains that it is a question not of
instinct but experience. He says himself that his
early works were lacking in dramatic quality, but he
does not agree that if it is not inborn it cannot be
developed. He maintains that the choice of librettos
has more to do with it than anything else, and from
the first he has worked a good deal in this way
by more than the usual amount of consultation and
exchange of ideas that goes on between a composer
and the writer of the book. Marie Antoinette, at the
time when I had the pleasure of talking with him, was
the subject for an opera which was, at least, uppermost
in his mind. "But I have thought of many
subjects and stories," he said. "La Faute de l'Abbé
Mouret and the Tartarin of Daudet are two well-known
ones. The latter is pure fun, but I have
always thought, when coming to the point, that I
should be accused, if I set it, of copying Verdi's
<i class="opus">Falstaff</i>. The former, I believe, Zola promised to
Massenet. I have also thought of Trilby; and
several excellent themes for plots could be gathered
from the stories of the later Roman Emperors." One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
statement at least was very characteristic of Puccini.
"My next plot must be one of sentiment to allow me
to work in my own way. I am determined not to go
beyond the place in art where I find myself at home."</p>

<p>Puccini is very fond of the theatre, and when last in
London enjoyed the production of <i class="opus">Oliver Twist</i>&mdash;he is
specially fond, in our literature, of Dickens&mdash;and <i class="opus">The
Tempest</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV">IV</a><br />

<span class="subhead">"LE VILLI"</span></h2>

<p>The Dal Verme Theatre, where Puccini's first opera
was produced, has been the scene of many experiments
in the art of opera. More than one composer has been
able to get a hearing there, if no more, and among the
list of trials and experiments&mdash;the value of which
taken as a whole will doubtless some day be accounted
at their proper worth, and which still come out like
shades of the night to remind us how little we appreciate
native endeavour&mdash;are to be found the names of
more than one English composer. Among the notable
successes which have been first launched at this theatre
is Leoncavallo's <i class="opus">I Pagliacci</i>.</p>

<p>The cast and general production of <i class="opus">Le Villi</i>, as has
been mentioned, was apparently more or less in the
nature of a friendly "helping hand" held out to the
unknown composer. The first performance was on
May 31, 1884, and the cast as follows:</p>

<table class="cast" summary="cast">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl"><i>Anna</i></td>
    <td class="tdl"><span class="smcap">Caponetti</span>.</td></tr>

    <td class="tdl"><i>Guglielmo Wulf</i></td>
    <td class="tdl"><span class="smcap">Pelz</span>.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>When one thinks of modern extravagance, supposedly
so necessary for the production of a new play or musical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
piece, it is little short of amazing to learn that the first
performance of <i class="opus">Le Villi</i> cost a little over £20. Of
course the main expenses were the costumes and the
copying of the orchestral parts. Puccini's fellow-students,
with that generous enthusiasm which is ever
part of the artistic temperament, cheerfully swelled the
ranks of the theatre orchestra, and Messrs. Ricordi
printed the libretto for nothing.</p>

<p><i class="opus">Le Villi</i> met with a favourable verdict, and Puccini's
mother received the following telegram on the night of
its production: "Theatre packed, immense success;
anticipations exceeded; eighteen calls; finale of first
act encored thrice."</p>

<p>The outcome of it all was that Messrs. Ricordi not
only bought the opera, but commissioned Puccini to
write another, thus beginning an association which has
not only been marked by commercial success but by a
very real and close friendship.</p>

<p>The following year it was given in a slightly revised
version, divided into two acts, at the Scala, Milan,
that Temple of Operatic Art which is the Mecca of
every aspiring Italian musician. This performance
took place on January 24, and was conducted by
Faccio, the cast being Pantaleoni, Anton, and Menotti.
It was not published by Ricordi until 1897, when it
appeared with an English version of Fontana's libretto
by Percy Pinkerton. In this year it was done at
Manchester, at the Comedy Theatre, by Mr. Arthur
Rousby's company, Mrs. Arthur Rousby being the
Anna, Mr. Henry Beaumont the Roberto, and Mr.
Frank Land the Wulf. Mr. Edgardo Levi conducted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Fontana's story was a curious one to be dealt with
by a Southern poet; for the basis of <i class="opus">Le Villi</i> is found
in one of those curious Northern legends which seem
to be the exclusive property of natures of far sterner
mould. The Villis, or witch-dancers, are spirits of
damsels who have been betrothed and whose lovers
have proved false. Garbed in their bridal gowns, they
rise from the earth at midnight and dance in a sort of
frenzy, till the dawn puts an end to their weird revelry.
Should they happen to meet one of their faithless
lovers, they beguile him into their circle with fair
promises; but, like the sirens of old mythology, they
do so only to take their revenge; for once within their
magic ring, the unrestful spirits whirl their victim
round and round until his strength is exhausted, and
then in fiendish exultation leave him to die in expiation
of his broken vows.</p>

<p>The scene of <i class="opus">Le Villi</i> is laid in the Black Forest.
An open clearing shows us the cottage of Wulf, behind
which a pathway leads to some rocks above, half
hidden by trees. A rustic bridge spans a defile, and
the exterior of the cottage is decorated with spring
flowers for the festival of betrothal. With this, his
first opera, Puccini adopted the Wagnerian plan which
he has since always adhered to, of a preludial introduction,
indicative of the general atmosphere of the
drama to follow, in place of the conventional overture.
As the curtain rises, Wulf, Anna and Roberto are
seated at a table outside the cottage, and the chorus
hail the betrothed pair in a joyful measure. As the
lovers move off to the back, the chorus tells something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
of the prospects of the two young people. Roberto is
the heir of a wealthy lady in Mayence. He will have
to visit her for the arrangement of the details of his
inheritance, and will then return to wed the bride.
The chorus then sings a characteristic waltz measure,
whirling and turning and singing that the dance is the
rival of love. It is a quick impulsive measure in A
minor, and foreshadows in a clever way the weird
dance which later on plays such an important part in
the scheme. Guglielmo, the father, is asked to join in
the dance, and he does so after a short instrumental
passage leading back to the dance and chorus proper.
Guglielmo dances off with his partner and the stage is
clear.</p>

<p>Anna comes down alone as the orchestra finish off
the rhythmic figure of the waltz. She holds a bunch
of forget-me-nots in her hand, and sings of remembrance
in a characteristic melody which at once reveals
Puccini's individuality both in melody and structure.
It varies considerably in the time, and has all that
impulsive charm of movement with which Puccini
always fits the situation and the sentiment. In actual
structure the melody moves along in flowing vocal
phrases, but they invariably drop on to an unexpected
note and reveal thereby that piquancy of flavour which
makes them singularly attractive. Anna is putting the
bunch of flowers, the token of remembrance, in
Roberto's valise when her lover comes in. Taking the
little bunch he kisses it and puts it back, and then begs
a token more fair&mdash;a smile. A characteristic duet then
follows, in which Anna gives expression to the doubts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
she feels at her lover's enforced absence. A delightfully
suave second section is sung by Roberto, in
which he tells her of his love, strong and unending,
born in the happy days of childhood. Anna catches
the spirit of his fervent devotion, and the duet ends
with their voices blending in a song of triumphant
trust. The voices end together on a low note, but the
orchestra carries the melody up to a high C by way of
a climax, and then gives out a bell-like sound skilfully
preceded by a chord of that somewhat abrupt modulation
in which Puccini always delights, which portends
the approach of night and the departure of Roberto.
This bell-like note of warning comes in again during
the short interlude which leads to the chorus, who
return to sing of Roberto's departure ere the bright
beams of sunset fade in the western sky.</p>

<p>Roberto bids Anna to be courageous, and asks her
father's blessing. Slow and solemn chords usher in
Guglielmo's touching prayer, in which after the opening
phrases the lovers join their voices, repeating the
sentiment of his pious utterances. Towards the end
the full chorus is added to the trio; and this solidly
written number, backed by a moving orchestral figure,
ends impressively. Anna sings her sad farewell, the
voice rising to a characteristic high A, and a short
orchestral passage finishes the scene.</p>

<p>The second act is headed "Forsaken" in the score,
and to the opening prelude is attached a short note
explanatory of what has happened in the meanwhile.
"In those days there was in Mayence a siren, who
bewitched all who beheld her, old and young." Like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
the presiding spirit of the Venusberg who held Tannhäuser
in thrall, so Roberto is attracted to her unholy
orgies and Anna is forgotten. Worn out by grief and
hopeless longing Anna dies, and in the opening chorus
of the second act we learn that she lies on her bier, her
features of marble paler than the moonlight. An
expressive and solemn funeral march, the main theme
of which is indicated by this preceding chorus, is then
played by the orchestra, during which the funeral
procession leaves Guglielmo's house and passes across
the stage. In order to add to the air of mystery this
is directed to be done behind a veil of gauze. At the
end, a three-part chorus of female voices chants a phrase
of the <i class="opus">Requiescat</i>. The tableaux curtains are dropped
for a change of scene. The place is the same, but the
time is winter, and the gaunt trees are snow laden.
The night is clear and starry, and pulsing lights flash
from the sides, adding their lurid and fitful brilliance to
the calm cold light of the moon.</p>

<p>With a sharp detached full chord in G minor, the
weird unearthly dance begins in quick duple time, the
quaint rhythmic melody being composed of staccato
triplets. Out of the darkness the figures of the witch-dancers
appear and join in the dance as the frenzy
increases. It is a highly characteristic movement, and
one can hardly agree with the critic who on its first
production, as will be seen hereafter, wished that it
might be in the major key. For an uncanny, utterly
restless and grim effect, most subtly presented by
means of purely legitimate music, this number stands
as an exceptionally fine example. The dance ends, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
the witch-dancers are swallowed up in the darkness,
while Guglielmo comes out to dwell on the villainy of
Roberto and the cruel wrong done to his dead child.
The prelude to his plaintive number is prefaced with a
striking descending passage for the chorus. As he
sings of the pure and gentle soul of his daughter, the
legend of the witch-dancers comes into his mind, but
at once he prays for forgiveness for such unworthy
thoughts of vengeance.</p>

<p>From a passage for the hidden voices of the sopranos
we expect the approach of Roberto. The recalcitrant
lover is startled by the sounds he hears, but he thinks
remorse, and not the Villis of the legend, is the cause
of it. Into his mind there flashes the remembrance of
all that has passed, and he goes towards the cottage-door
with a pathetic hope that Anna may still be
living. But he starts back as some irresistible force
compels him to retreat. Again he thinks a wild fancy
has deceived him, but once more the voices sound the
note of approaching doom. "See the traitor is
coming." He kneels in prayer, but at the end comes
in the sinister phrase, "See the traitor is coming." He
rises from his prayer to curse the evil influence that
has wrought his destruction.</p>

<p>Then, at the back, on the bridge, appears the spirit
of Anna. Amazed, Roberto exclaims, "She is living,
not dead!" but Anna replies that she is not his love
but revenge, and reminds him, by a repetition of her
solo in the first act, when she sang to the bunch of
forget-me-nots, of all his broken promises. Roberto
joins in this strenuous and moving duet, and accepts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
with resignation the fate that has been too strong for
him. Torn with the anguish of remorse he expresses
his willingness to die. Anna holds out her arms, and
Roberto seems hypnotised. Gradually the witch-dancers
come on, and surrounding the pair dance once
more in frenzy row carry them off. Over the characteristic
dance is now placed a full chorus. The words
"whirling, turning," which frequently occur as the
movement gains in intensity, show the connection with
the joyous measure in the first act. In this we find
one of those effects of unity which, although slight
enough in many cases, reveal the hand, if not exactly
of a great master, of an original thinker and a particularly
finished craftsman. Roberto, at the end of the
main section of the chorus, ending on a long sustained
top A, and then dropping sharply to the tonic (it is
still as before in G minor), breaks away breathless and
terrified and strives to enter the cottage; but the spirits
drive him again into the arms of Anna, and once more
he is drawn into the whirlpool. With a last despairing
shriek, "Anna, save me!" he dies; and Anna, with
an exultant cry of possession, vanishes, while the
chorus change the words of their song to a shout of
exultation.</p>

<p>By this first effort, slight in texture as it is, Puccini
gave unmistakable evidence of that power of giving,
by a series of detached scenes, an idea of impressionistic
atmospheric quality which was afterwards so
beautifully achieved in his <i class="opus">La Bohème</i>. From the

chapter, was present at the meeting at Ponchielli's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
house which led to the production of the opera, we get
a sound idea of the general effect and trend of the
music, which is worth quoting. It appeared in
<i class="opus">Italia</i> of the day after the performance, at which, it
may be mentioned, Boïto applauded vigorously from a
box.</p>

<p>"It is, according to our judgment, a precious little
gem, from beginning to end. The prelude, not meant
to be important, is full of delicate instrumental passages,
and contains the theme afterwards used in the first
duet between the lovers. The chorus which follows
is gay and festive and shows masterly handling of the
parts: the waltz, which we should have preferred in a
major key, is entrancing, one of the most characteristic
numbers of the opera is the duet between Anna and
Roberto. The prayer of benediction is another
inspired page, in spite of its length. The polyphony
of the vocal parts is masterly and the melodic flow
most charming. The symphonic nature of the intermezzi
which connect the scenes, more particularly the
wild dance of the spirit forms, distinctly points to the
arrival of a great composer."</p>

<p>While the salient points of the music appear to have
been unerringly seized upon by the writer, the subtlety
of the composer in making the first dance of the
peasants foreshadow the furious revelry of the witch-dancers
appears to have escaped the critic. But this
desire for strongly marked effects is after all essentially
typical of the race. In Italy, the clear, radiant sky,
the pure air, the glorious strength of the light, does
not permit of an appreciation for half-tones and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
fascination of shadows. If all need not exactly be
dazzlingly bright it must be quite distinct. <i class="opus">Le Villi</i>
was a remarkable first opera, but it has not succeeded
in keeping a place in the current repertory. The
music is unquestionably dramatic, but the whole
structure, words and music, has not that quality of
characterisation which, together with the necessary
dramatic force, makes up the theatrical effectiveness
without which no opera can ever expect to hold the
stage. To use a hackneyed phrase, <i class="opus">Le Villi</i> has the
defects of its qualities, but from the freshness and
individuality of its music there is no reason why it
should not be given in our concert-rooms as a cantata.
The dance movement, after all, would lose nothing by
being given as an orchestral piece, and the spirit forms
might well be left to the imagination. At any rate,
<i class="opus">Le Villi</i> is, by a very long way, a far greater work than
many a so-called "dramatic" cantata. These things
take the place in our provincial towns of the opera
abroad; and since we do not appear in the least
likely to establish opera houses, it would be a good
plan for the British composer to take Puccini's <i class="opus">Le
Villi</i> as an example of what might be done with a
cantata&mdash;an opera, after all, played without action or
scenery.</p>

<p>With his second work for the stage, <i class="opus">Edgar</i>&mdash;the
libretto being by Fontana, the author of the opera-ballet
<i class="opus">Le Villi</i>&mdash;Puccini adopts the designation of lyric
drama. <i class="opus">Edgar</i> is in three acts, and with it the composer
attained to the dignity of a first performance at
the Scala, Milan. It saw the light on April 21, 1889,
with the following cast, the conductor being Faccio:</p>

<p>The vocal score was not published by Ricordi until
1905.</p>

<p>The theme of the drama is the familiar one of a
man tempted by passion, who swerves from the "strait
and narrow path," and who afterwards makes atonement.
In the case of our hero, Edgar, the atonement
comes too late, and the end, as in <i class="opus">Carmen</i>&mdash;which in
general dramatic outline may be called the foremost
if not the first operatic exploitation of the idea&mdash;is
Tragedy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 496px;"><img id="i40" src="images/i065.jpg" width="496" height="328" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">PUCCINI IN HIS STUDY AT TORRE DEL LAGO</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
In front of his book Fontana places a foreword to
the effect that we are all Edgars, because fate brings
to each of us love and death. He winds up with a
moral statement, true if trite, that it is wrong to let
ourselves be dragged away from pure love to mere
sensual passion.</p>

<p>The action takes place in Flanders in the early fourteenth
century. The scene of the first of the three acts
shows us a square in a Flemish village, at the back of
which is Edgar's house, and before it an almond tree.
On the one side is the entrance to a church, on the
other an inn.</p>

<p>Over the distant landscape dawn is breaking. With
a bell effect, of which Puccini is so fond, the simple
prelude begins. The plain and straightforward progression
of light chords is French in character, but
the bell effect is established musically by the simple
leap of a fifth in the bass. The chords continue, with
a filagree figure placed above them, and from delicate
musical suggestion the effect turns to realism as the
bell itself sounds, ushering in the notes of the unseen
chorus, as the Angelus rings from the church.</p>

<p>Edgar is asleep on a bench before the inn, and
peasants and shepherds cross the stage, greeting each
other as they go to their daily toil. Fidelia, the
daughter of Gualtiero, then comes on to the balcony
and salutes the dawn in a characteristic melody which,
although not based on the bell theme in the way of the
use of a representative phrase, seems very naturally
to grow out of the musical idea. She calls to Edgar
and comes down, plucking a branch from the almond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
tree. Fidelia continues her address to Edgar in a
melody which is much more broken in rhythm than
her former one; and on her departure a curious
chromatic passage, which seems to presage unrest and
stress, leads to the entry of the chorus, who repeat,
from afar but coming nearer, their greeting to the
dawn, while Edgar turns to go after Fidelia.</p>

<p>Strongly dramatic and of distinctive colour is the
orchestral passage which accompanies the entrance of
Tigrana. She is a gipsy girl, who has been brought up
by the villagers. She enters with a species of lute&mdash;or
guitar, more properly perhaps&mdash;called the dembal, a
stringed instrument in common use even now by
descendants of the Magyar race. She laughs at Edgar
with a fine scorn of his tame admiration for the gentle
village damsel. "There! I have made Fidelia run
away," she sings with a mixture of sarcasm, irony, and
hypocrisy. "I am so sorry. I did not know a pastoral
love affair was at all in your way."</p>

<p>Gualtiero, Fidelia's father, now comes on, and, with
the gathering crowd of villagers, enters the church.
The beginning of the voluntary on the organ is heard,
and over and above this simple diatonic, ecclesiastical
tune, come, in skilful and expressive contrast, the
remarks of the gipsy girl to Edgar, by which she
reminds him that she has opened to his nature the
delights of an intense full-blooded love in place of the
mildly inocuous affection of peasant girls. "Trot
along, good little boy," she sings, "and go to church."
Edgar's feeling about the matter is quickly shown by
his emphatic "Silence, demon!" which comes out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
like the crack of a whip. But Tigrana only laughs
at him.</p>

<p>As Tigrana turns to go into the inn she is stopped
by Frank, the brother of Fidelia. Frank is in love
with the gipsy girl, and from him we learn that fifteen
years ago she was abandoned in the village. Questioned
as to her doings, Tigrana tells Frank that he is a tiresome
bore, while he proceeds with the not very tactful
method of reproaching her for her ingratitude. "You
were the child of us all," he sings, "and we did not
know we were nursing a viper in our midst."</p>

<p>Tigrana, who is not given to wasting much time
with preliminaries, tells Frank that if he has any regard
for his virtue he had better not be seen talking to her;
and she goes towards the inn. Frank bursts out with
the confession that he has tried to tear her out of his
heart, but although she brings nothing but grief to him
she remains there in full possession.</p>

<p>From the church comes the sound of a fragment of
a motet, begun by the sopranos and swelling out afterwards
in a six-part chorus. Tigrana sits on the table
outside the inn and jeers at the piety of those peasants
who, not being able to find room in the church, kneel
outside and join in the devotion. To her dembal she
sings a quaint and springy sort of tune which is
thoroughly impudent in character. With a murmur
of disapproval, which afterwards grows into a demand,
the peasants indignantly ask her to desist from her
frivolity. As she proceeds with her melody the peasants
threaten to take stronger measures to stop the interruption
to their prayers, and Edgar, coming out, rushes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
at once to Tigrana's defence. This open devotion to
her cause apparently surprises the villagers greatly,
and Edgar finds himself called upon at once to make
up his somewhat vacillating mind. With rather curious
and certainly sudden access of ardour, he rails against
his lot, and curses the home of his fathers. Egged on
to a species of frenzy, he rushes into the house and
comes out bearing an ember from the hearth. In spite
of the efforts of the villagers to restrain his mad impulse
he flings the brand into the house, and clasping Tigrana
to him, announces his intention of fleeing with her.
Frank then rushes on to prevent their departure, and
the two young men draw their daggers. A lull in the
fray is caused by the entrance of Gualtiero and Fidelia
from the church; and the old man's counsel for peace
backed up by pious ejaculations from the crowd, seems
likely at first to prevail. But Tigrana puts an end to
Edgar's hesitation, and he attacks Frank with fury.
Frank is badly wounded, and falls in his father's arms
as the chorus curse Edgar for a reprobate, and the
curtain falls as the house, now well ablaze, lights up the
scene with its lurid glare.</p>

<p>The second act shows us a terrace in a garden with
the brilliantly lighted rooms of a sumptuous mansion
glimmering in the distance. The stillness of the night
is broken by the sounds of revelry, more languorous
than strident. The chorus, which sing of the splendour
of the night, is made up of two sopranos, an alto, two
tenors, and a bass; and the essentially nervous, close
harmonies&mdash;the light detached phrase begins with a
chord of the 13th&mdash;establish the atmosphere. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
is some fine and characteristic music in this rather
long scene between Edgar and Tigrana, who have, it
is easy to understand, been partaking too freely of the
joys which soon pall. Edgar is weary of his enervating
surroundings, and his thoughts turn to the glory of
the April dawn and the calm love of Fidelia. Tigrana
taunts him with reproaches, and there follow the
inevitable mutual recriminations. In vain does she
bring her fascinations to bear upon her lover. The
sound of drums and the march of soldiers is heard,
and Edgar calls out to them as they pass to stay their
march and partake of his hospitality. Tigrana at once
begins to be suspicious. Frank, as it turns out, is the
captain of the band. Edgar hails him with joy as the
saviour of the situation. "Frank, forgive me," he
cries. "You alone can save me and enable me to
redeem my past." Tigrana is distracted, but she
is powerless to prevent Edgar's departure, and with a
menacing gesture she sees her lover go, a characteristic
phrase from the chorus forming the background to the
last utterances of the principals concerned in this short
and not particularly convincing act.</p>

<p>The third act is prefaced with a short prelude of
melancholy mould. The rising curtain discloses a
courtyard within a fortress at Courtray. In the battle
which raged round this castle, the Flemish, it will be
remembered, with very few numbers&mdash;and these only
armed with agricultural implements for the most part&mdash;conquered
the French army led by Philip Le Bel.
Their opponents were decoyed into a sort of marshy
swamp, and were not only hampered by their large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
retinue, which included carriages, women-kind, and all
sorts of paraphernalia, but imagined that they were
only to meet a handful of ignorant churls. There is a
chapel on one side of the scene, and distant trumpet
calls are heard as a funeral <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cortège</i> proceeds to range
itself around a hearse, and the monks in the procession
light tapers.</p>

<p>Preceded by a draped banner, the soldiers bear on
the body of a knight, fully armed, which they place on
the hearse and then deck it with flowers and wreaths.
Standing apart from the crowd are Frank and a monk,
while in the background are seen Fidelia and her
father. The chorus chant a <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Requiescat</i>, and then
Fidelia sings a most moving and pathetic farewell, for
the armed knight is Edgar. It may be stated, however,
that the monk who stands apart is really Edgar,
who, for no very clear or convincing reason, has chosen
to be a witness of his supposed funeral celebration.</p>

<p>Frank now adds his praise to the farewell of Fidelia,
and extols in an oration the splendid courage of the
man Edgar who died for his fatherland. Then the
monk does a seemingly strange and unwarrantable
thing. He tells the soldiers that their hero, before
death, directed that all his misdeeds should be proclaimed
publicly, in order that his life might set an
example in true penitence. The monk then relates
the story of Edgar's past life, and discloses among
other details the relations existing between the dead
man and Tigrana.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 442px;"><img id="i46" src="images/i074.jpg" width="442" height="307" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><p>PUCCINI IN HIS STUDY AT HIS MILAN HOUSE</p>

<p><i class="cite">Specially photographed by Adolfo Ermini, Milan</i></p></div></div>

<p>Fidelia, filled with horror at the supposed treachery,
boldly asks how the soldiers dare to listen to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
besmirching of their leader's honour. The soldiers,
however, appear to believe the tale, and make an
attempt to drag the body off to throw it to the vultures.
The monk is touched by the loyalty of Fidelia, who is
prepared to defend, with her life if needs be, the body
of her hero. "By death," she cries, "he has expiated
his sins. Leave me to watch him through the night,
and my father and I will bear his body away in the
morning and find for it some resting-place in his native
village." The monk then kneels for a space by Fidelia;
and the soldiers, touched by her devotion, move off,
and Fidelia leaves with her father.</p>

<p>Tigrana now enters, and, like Fidelia, would pay her
tribute of respect to the dead man. Frank and the
monk, however, after a little consultation, put a little
plan of theirs into operation, and approach Tigrana.
"Would that I were the object of your grief," says
Frank. "One tear of yours is worth a thousand
pearls." The monk then comes out with some rather
plainer speaking, and deliberately bribes the erstwhile
gipsy with some jewels if she will do their bidding.
Tigrana very readily falls into the trap and the soldiers
are recalled. The monk now calls on Tigrana to
speak out, and prove that Edgar was a traitor to his
country. She hesitates for a moment, but finally
acknowledges that the accusation is true. In righteous
anger the soldiers rush to the hearse and drag the
body away, but the armour is found to be merely the
empty pieces and no body is encased therein. Fidelia
and her father now come on, and the fraud is disclosed
to them. "Yes," cries the monk, throwing back his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
cowl, "for Edgar lives." Fidelia, at first stunned by
the joyful discovery that her lover lives, throws herself
into his arms, and Tigrana is spurned by the soldiers.
With an exclamation, "I am redeemed, only love is
the real truth," Edgar leads Fidelia towards the
castle. Like a tiger cat, Tigrana follows them, and
with a savage leap stabs Fidelia, who dies instantly.
Edgar and Frank turn and seize the murderess, and
the soldiers, with a bloodthirsty cry, hale her off
to instant execution. With a cry of despair Edgar
falls senseless across Fidelia's body.</p>

<p><i class="cite">Specially photographed by Adolfo Ermini, Milan</i></p></div></div>

<p>Notwithstanding many serious shortcomings, <i class="opus">Edgar</i>,
as a lyric drama, contains much that is sincere and
appropriate. It was not a success on its first representation,
and the blame was laid for the most part on
the libretto. Seeing, however, in the history of opera
how many a worse book has passed muster, it is a
little curious that Puccini's second work should have
been so completely laid on the shelf. It is not the
lack of dramatic qualities that make the story of <i class="opus">Edgar</i>
a poor one; it is rather that the story, as a play, does
not contain enough of characterisation to really retain
the interest. In spite of the weak third act, with its
supposed dead body, and the hero in disguise, the
music of this section, both from its wealth of melody,
its treatment, and above all its powerful expressive
qualities, stands as the best in the work. A finer or
more moving scene than that of Fidelia's farewell is
hardly to be found in the whole range of what may be
termed modern opera. Taken as it stands <i class="opus">Edgar</i>
proved that Puccini had emphatically progressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
beyond his achievement of <i class="opus">Le Villi</i>. Amid the sweet
notes of love there come strong and virile expressions
of anger, tumult and indignation, but the main theme
is kept clearly to the front with all that force that
stands as the leading characteristic of Italian opera,
old or new&mdash;definite and direct vocal expression.</p>

<p>Puccini himself had, and still has by all accounts, a
very warm affection for this <i class="opus">Edgar</i> of his; and it is not
at all unlikely that a revised version may be seen in
the near future. Indeed, as it stands, it might very
well be permitted the test of a revival.</p>

<span class="subhead">"MANON"</span></h2>

<p>Auber was the first opera-composer to be attracted by
the Abbé Prévost's famous romance <i class="opus">Manon Lescaut</i>.
It is one of those vivid stories of love and passion
which have ever made an appeal to those in search of
a theme for musical expression. As drama it has a
very close connection with life in general, and its
human interest has that full flesh-and-blood quality
which gives it a certain quick vitality. Sad and sordid
it may be; but the story of the wayward Manon, as
fascinating a black sheep as ever graced the pages of
fiction&mdash;or history&mdash;is one which is likely to remain
in the common stock of tales which provides novelists
with material for practically all time.</p>

  <div class="caption">PUCCINI'S MANUSCRIPT SCORES, FROM THE SECOND ACT OF "TOSCA"</div>
</div>

<p>The chief romances of the Abbé are the <i class="opus">Mémoires
d'un Homme de Qualité</i>, <i class="opus">Cleveland</i>, and <i class="opus">Doyen de Killerine</i>
(the two latter, by the way, books which show the
result of his sojourn in England). While these exhibit
certain well-marked qualities, they are completely cast
into the shade by <i class="opus">Manon Lescaut</i>, his masterpiece, and
one of the greatest novels of the eighteenth century,
while, from its characterisation, it may be pointed to
as the father of the modern novel. The Chevalier des<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Grieux is an embodiment of the saying "Love first and
the rest nowhere," and it is curious that the Abbé
made a French translation of Dryden's once famous
play on the same theme, <i class="opus">All for Love</i>. Manon, as a
creation, is a triumph, one of the most remarkable
heroines in fiction, springing red-hot as it were from
the imagination of the wandering scholar who brought
her into existence. It is all the more extraordinary
that the novel which at once makes an appeal by its
interest and sincerity, but which repays study as a
work of art, should have been a sort of appendix to his
first work.</p>

<p>Some years after Auber's opera had been laid on the
shelf&mdash;it never attained to any great popularity&mdash;Massenet,
a notable "modern" French composer,
found by means of its story the expression of quite the
best that was in him. Since <i class="opus">Carmen</i> modern French
opera has no such masterpiece of its kind to show.
Massenet's <i class="opus">Manon</i> was produced in 1884, and in the
fulness of time Puccini turned to the same story, and
after planning his own <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">scenario</i>, commissioned Domenico
Oliva&mdash;dramatic critic of the <i class="cite">Journal d'Italia</i> of Rome,
and author of a play <i class="opus">Robespierre</i> which had attained no
little success&mdash;to write the "book." This was afterwards
so drastically altered and remodelled by Puccini,
in consultation with Ricordi, the publisher, that in
justice to Oliva, his name as the author of the libretto
was removed from the published score.</p>

<p>It was produced in 1893 at the Regio Theatre, Turin,
on the 1st of February, conducted by Alexander Pomé,
and cast as follows:</p>

<p>For a new work by a composer whose reputation

Garden with the following cast, comprising a special

<p class="in0">and A. Seppilli was the conductor. The occasion was
interesting in more than one way. The season under
Sir Augustus Harris began on the very unusual day&mdash;a
Whit-Monday. The opera house had been renovated
entirely and re-upholstered, with new seats and
curtains, and glittered fresh in all the glories of paint
and gilding. Tradition has it that this was the only
time in forty years&mdash;since the building of the present
house in fact&mdash;had a broom ever been known to go
into every corner. Yet another point makes this
opening of the season memorable. It began with this
new opera of Puccini's, and then gave Verdi's <i class="opus">Falstaff</i>
the same week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Without making an "odious" comparison it is
obvious that reference should be made to Massenet's
work and the differences between that and Puccini's
opera briefly touched upon.</p>

<p>In both versions certain departures are made, so far
as the story goes, from the original tale. Let us first
examine Massenet's book. This opens in the courtyard
of an inn at Amiens to which Lescaut, a soldier
who is evidently given to loose living, brings his pretty
little sister Manon <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en route</i> for the convent school to
which she is destined. She meets with the handsome
Chevalier des Grieux, and easily falls in love with him.
The quiet life of schoolroom and convent does not
make a very strong appeal to the high-spirited girl, and
she very quickly decides to run away to Paris, and
give her brother the slip. At first honourable intentions
as to the pretty and confiding Manon's future
seem to weigh with the lover, but in the second act we
find them installed in the customary <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ménage à deux</i>,
Des Grieux's father having declined to give his consent
to a marriage. Thus almost at the beginning Fate
seems to be against Manon, and she accepts only too
easily the situation and&mdash;drifts. Des Grieux's
"sinews of war" being anything but opulent, it is
easy to understand why the offers of the aristocrat De
Bretigny are too tempting for Manon to refuse. To
him she transfers her affections, and we next see her
established at Cours-la-Reine, the fêted and admired
mistress of Bretigny. But during the ball she hears
that her former lover has renounced the world with its
pomps and vanities and is preparing to take orders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
With that instinct known as the truly feminine, Manon
immediately makes up her mind that she wants Des
Grieux back again; and after a strenuous scene at the
seminary of S. Sulpice we find, in the third act, that
Des Grieux has thrown his good resolutions to the
winds and is again with his charmer. Manon by this
time has become rather more than a fragile butterfly
from whose wings the bloom has been brushed. She
is now running a gambling den, with the help, apparently,
of one of her numerous admirers. Des Grieux
and this person come to loggerheads, and the latter
informs the police of the nature of the gaming house,
and Manon is ignominiously dragged off to the lock-up.
The last scene shows us Manon being taken by road
to Havre, from whence she is to be shipped, in company
with other undesirables, to the New Continent.
Des Grieux sees her, and begs the warder to allow him
an interview. Worn out by remorse and weakened by
her former life, Manon, now reduced to the last stage
of infirmity, dies peacefully in her lover's arms.</p>

<p>Puccini's librettists follow a different plan, and the
<i class="opus">Manon</i> of the Italian composer is a species of
impressionistic scenes more or less loosely strung together,
which, while they demand perhaps a knowledge
of the story for their full appreciation&mdash;and to opera
goers the story is, of course, quite familiar&mdash;exhibit
that quality of conjuring up the atmosphere not so
much of the actual place and characters, but of the
spirit which underlies the pathetic tragedy. In short,
Puccini's <i class="opus">Manon</i>&mdash;music and story, for it is impossible
to separate them&mdash;exhibits that skilful picturing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
theme which is even more apparent in the subsequent
work, <i class="opus">La Bohème</i>.</p>

<p>In Puccini's opera we find after the meeting of
Manon and Des Grieux at the inn at Amiens that the
gay young lady is installed as the mistress of Geronte,
and rather less stress, perhaps, is laid on the part her
rascally brother plays in the transaction. By giving
the final scene in America, whither Des Grieux follows
the ruined girl, Puccini's librettists follow the Abbe's
original story rather more closely. Other actual
differences will be noted by following the plan, as
in the previous chapters, of giving a more or less
detailed story of the opera, with plot and music
side-by-side.</p>

<p>Puccini begins his <i class="opus">Manon</i> with a short, bustling,
vivacious prelude which continues for some twenty
bars or so after the rise of the curtain, which discloses,
as in Massenet's first act, the exterior of an inn at
Amiens, with a crowd of citizens, students and girls,
strolling about the square and the avenue. One of
the students, Edmund, sings of the beautiful night
dear to lovers and poets, and the band of his merry
companions cut his vapourings short with laughter
and jest. Presently the work-girls come down, and
Edmund sings to two of them a graceful, lively fantasy
of youth and love, which is afterwards taken up by the
chorus of students. In characteristic fashion, the
citizens join in, and we get one of those solidly written
but vivacious choruses, a form which Puccini handles
so well and dexterously, with similar splendour of
technic to the immortal Leipsic Cantor, keeping each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
part clear and effective. Des Grieux comes on and
laughingly asks some of the girls whether among them
is to be found the one his heart dreams of. The
chorus continues in its gay spirit of song, dance and
laughter until the sound of a postillion's horn calls
their attention to the arrival of the coach from Arras.
An orchestral passage repeating the brisk theme of the
opening prelude leads up to the entry of the diligence,
from which Lescaut and Geronte di Lavoir descend,
the latter assisting Manon to alight. While the
travellers give their orders to the landlord, Des Grieux
catches sight of Manon, and is attracted by her face
and figure. The crowd has dispersed and the students
settle down to cards, and then Des Grieux speaks to
the girl. In a pretty little musical dialogue, which
Puccini always expresses so dramatically and with a
sort of naturalness that may be called colloquial, the
pair make each other's acquaintance, and, like the
conventional action of writing of letters on the stage,
the result is arrived at in the twinkling of an eye.
Manon is called off by her brother's voice, and Des
Grieux has his first love song, a tender impassioned
melody full of great charm and lyrical strength.
Edmund and the other students then chaff him as to
the fair charmer good fortune has sent him, and Des
Grieux makes his escape to think over his conquest.
Another typical number, a duet in chorus between the
students and the girls in a quick valse time, is broken
by the arrival of Geronte and the brother, from whose
dialogue we learn the sister is destined for a convent,
and that the brother is not at all sorry to be quit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
of his responsibility in the matter of looking after
her. Geronte di Lavoir, the elderly and lecherous
nobleman, appears to be a chance acquaintance, who
has met with Lescaut and his sister while travelling
in the coach. The carelessness of Lescaut and his
evidently mercenary nature fits in only too readily with
Geronte's desires, for he is immediately attracted to
the artless little girl from the country and lays his evil
plans. Darkness falls on the scene. Lescaut is attracted
to the card-players, and joins them quickly in
the hopes of adding to his store of wealth, and Geronte
bargains with the innkeeper for a post-chaise and some
swift horses, giving instructions that a lady will want
to pop off very quickly to Paris in a short time.
Edmund overhears this little plot, and discloses it to
his friend Des Grieux. A short characteristic orchestral
passage with a changing unrestful rhythm leads up
to Manon's entrance. With a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">naïveté</i> expressed in the
music she sings, she comes to Des Grieux and tells
him that she has kept her thoughtless promise. In a
beautifully phrased impassioned passage Des Grieux
urgently presses his suit. Manon, who continues to
hang back a little, is overcome, and when an interruption
from her brother, on whom the effects of wine is
beginning to tell, startles them out of their ecstatic
rapture, she attempts to return to the inn. But Des
Grieux takes her away, and tells her of the plot of the
old reprobate to abduct her, and urges her to escape
with himself.</p>

<p>Edmund now tells Geronte of the escape of his prize,
and that disappointed old <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roué</i> tries to rouse the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
brother from his lethargy. Lescaut decides that pursuit
is worthless, and suggests following the pair to Paris,
whither he is sure they have gone. Geronte stifles
his fury and goes in to supper, while the students join
in with a merry chorus, laughing at the old man's
discomfiture as the act ends.</p>

<p>A few bars of a light tripping measure against a
slight accompaniment of pizzicato chords from the
strings opens the second act, the scene of which shows
Manon installed in Geronte's luxurious house in Paris.
Manon's toilette is being finished off by the perruquier,
and the detached remarks and inquiries for the various
articles necessary are musically "popped in" with a
skilful hand. The brother comes in, and while the
finishing process is still proceeding, he congratulates
his sister on the transference of her affections from
the penniless Des Grieux to the rich old nobleman.
Manon, however, is by no means "off" with the old
love, and in a tender little melody she sings of the
humble dwelling where she and her lover passed a
blissful time. Like so many of Puccini's melodies it
begins by a reiteration of a single note, which gradually
spreads itself into a lyrical flow. This works up into
an expressive little duet, in which Manon longs for
Des Grieux's return, and Lescaut promises to make
him a successful gamester in order to gather in the
necessary funds.</p>

<p>Some singers now arrive, and Manon explains that
Geronte is a composer, and likes to air his art for her
delectation. A mezzo soprano then begins a tuneful
madrigal of a pastoral character, pleasantly melodious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
but which hardly gives the idea, in full, of a certain
stilted artificiality which is the peculiar flavour of the
period. The other female voices join in a three-part
chorus. Manon is rather bored with their music, and
directs her brother to give them some money to get rid
of them. The brother then departs to find Des Grieux,
and Geronte and his friends arrive to a dainty little
orchestral measure of the character of a minuet, with
its fanciful little trills and twirls, but with its syncopated
bass to preserve the idea of movement and
progress. The dancing-master gives some hints in
deportment to Manon, and the chorus of Abbés and
other friends of Geronte's murmur their admiration at
her graces. In a spirited little number Manon, who
has politely told the company not to interrupt her
lesson, sings to Geronte of the pleasure she is experiencing
in her present life, and with characteristic
skill the chorus is worked into the scheme as part of
the musical fabric, and not merely as a decorative
background.</p>

<p>After the departure of Geronte and his guests,
Des Grieux, who has been told of Manon's whereabouts
by the brother, comes in. The scene between
them is musically full of emotional force, Des Grieux
expressing his loneliness and despair at Manon's
flight, while Manon deplores her weakness and assures
him of her love in spite of all that the present situation
entails. The highly dramatic duet works up to a fine
intensity, and at the end their voices blend in a clever
climax of a kind&mdash;a few strenuous reiterated notes
in unison taking an upward leap at the finish&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
characteristic of the composer. Their happiness is
short lived, for Geronte comes in and puts them to
confusion. After cajoling him into something like
sweet reasonableness, Manon thinks the little affair
will blow over. But her truly feminine desire for a
compromise, a gentle slipping over of things, is not to
be fulfilled. Des Grieux, when they are once more
alone, tells Manon that her present life is impossible,
that she must give it all up and fly with him. He has
a fine broad melody when Manon tries to return to her
plan of letting things go on as they are. Manon is
moved by his intensity, and begs once again for
forgiveness, and agrees to wholly give her heart to
him. Lescaut now rushes in breathless to acquaint
Des Grieux and his sister that Geronte has put the
police on their track. The scene works up into a
clever trio of quick movement, Manon imperilling
herself and her companion by her desire to carry off
as much spoil as she can lay hands on. Geronte,
attended by a sergeant and two men, block the entrance,
and Manon in her surprise and agitation drops her
cloak, and the jewels roll to the floor. With this
effective finish&mdash;Manon being arrested, as we may
suppose, in this instance for larceny, and the grimness
of the situation intensified by the rascally brother's
double-dealing in the matter being hinted at&mdash;the act
closes, Des Grieux being held back from rescuing his
beloved, and uttering a cry of despair.</p>

<p>Before the third act comes a characteristic orchestral
interlude, in which the Wagnerian plan of continuing
the story by means of a symphonic tone poem is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
employed with individuality by Puccini. This intermezzo
deals with two main ideas or phases, first
the imprisonment of Manon, and secondly the sad
journey to Havre, the port whence the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">filles de joie</i>&mdash;how
intensely sad is the irony of the description!&mdash;are
to be taken over seas. To the score is appended a
quotation from the Abbé Prévost's story, giving the
clue to the strain of passion that comes in the music
of this number, and blends skilfully with the sadness
and the sense of movement which are its leading
flavours, so to speak.</p>

<p>Des Grieux says in the story, "How I love her!
My passion is so ardent that I feel I am the most
unhappy creature alive. What have I not tried in
Paris to obtain her release. I have implored the aid
of the powerful. I have knocked at every door as
a suppliant. I have even resorted to force. All has
been in vain. Only one thing remains for me, and
that is to follow her&mdash;go where she may&mdash;even unto
the end of the world."</p>

<p>The scene of the third act shows the square near the
harbour at Havre, with the sea and a ship in the
distance. To the left is the barracks serving as a
temporary prison, and at the gate a sentinel keeps
guard. Des Grieux and the brother have evidently
been keeping their vigil all through the night, and
dawn is about to break. Very poignant and striking
is the fevered agitation shown in the dialogue passages
which open the scene. The brother has done his best
to arrange for a rescue when his unhappy sister shall
be brought forth and marched on board. The sentinel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
who now comes on duty has been bribed, and Des
Grieux is able to hold a conversation with Manon
through the barred window. As the night passes into
day, the all too short interview ends, and Des Grieux
gives some final instructions to Manon. But the plans
for the rescue fail, and Lescaut comes back to tell Des
Grieux of their failure as the clamour of citizens and
soldiers is heard. After a spirited snatch of chorus,
the roll on the drums gives the signal for the gate of
the barracks to open, out of which the women, in chains,
pass out to the ship. The chorus in some telling little
abrupt phrases pass remarks as the various names
are read out, and the vivacious comments and rough
laughter heighten the effect of sadness as Manon and
Des Grieux snatch their last farewell. Manon hangs
behind a little, only to be roughly pushed on by a
sergeant. Then it is that Des Grieux's despair gets
the upper hand. "Kill me," he cries, "or take me
along with you as your meanest servant." The
captain is touched by his devotion, and in the
bluff, good-natured fashion of the sailor, agrees to
take Des Grieux.</p>

<p>In the fourth act the death of Manon puts an end to
this sad but very human tragedy. The music is one
long duet, full of the highest emotional expression, and
musically reaches to the highest heights of pure
tragedy. The scene shows us a desolate dreary plain
on the outskirts of New Orleans. Manon and Des
Grieux by their dress and manner show the destitution
of their circumstances. "Lean all your weight on me,
love," murmurs Des Grieux, as he supports his companion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
worn out by fatigue and privation. Manon
suffers from thirst, and Des Grieux, who can find no
water in this arid waste, goes out to search farther
afield. Memories of the life that is past now come to
torture poor Manon, and when Des Grieux comes in
again he finds her hopelessly distraught and at the
point of death. Very touchingly does the music Manon
sings picture the ebbing life, the faltering breath, the
approach of the end; and, with a long, low phrase on
one note, Manon, whose last words are that her love
for Des Grieux will never pass although her sins will
be cleansed away, sinks peacefully in her long last
sleep. Bursting into tears Des Grieux falls senseless
over her body.</p>

<p>It is inevitable to return to a comparison between
this work of Puccini's and that of Massenet. Massenet
remains supreme in his own place from the delicate
and spirited characterisation of his music. His Manon
is essentially French, entirely of the eighteenth century,
bringing out in the music all the artificiality, all the
airs and graces. While the story is not without flesh
and blood, it remains as a thing apart, moving in its
own sphere, full of its own special atmosphere.
Puccini takes the same French story and gives us a
moving lyric drama, which is on a far broader plane,
is essentially human and common to every place, every
race and all time, since it deals with purely elemental
passions.</p>

<p>Since <i class="opus">Manon</i> was the work by which Puccini's
operatic music was first given to the English music-lovers,
the following extracts from the critiques which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
appeared after its first performance in England will be
of interest.</p>

<p>There is nothing which brings back the past so
vividly as the fascinating process of turning up back
files of daily papers. The actual day and all the
"common round" come back like a living thing; so
many of the "trivial tasks" seem to assume quite a
special importance of their own. To read the advertisements,
the announcements of concerts, theatres and
picture galleries, is to remember events and pleasant
moments which have long passed out of one's mind.
Speaking as a journalist, the astonishing thing to me is
that the daily paper of twelve years ago or so should
seem such an old-fashioned thing to look at. One
does not feel this with regard to the journals of a far
more remote age. It is only these few recent years
that seem to have rushed along at such a fearful pace.</p>

<p>The <i class="opus">Morning Post</i> calls attention to the enterprise
shown by producing a new work on the opening night
of the season and promising another&mdash;Verdi's <i class="opus">Falstaff</i>
to wit&mdash;within the first week.</p>

<p>Mr. Arthur Hervey, its critic, says: "Now that
Italian composers have once more come to the fore we
may expect to be well provided with operas from the
quondam land of song, and now the home <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i>
of the melodramatic opera. Mascagni and Leoncavallo
having been duly welcomed, it is now the turn of
Puccini, the much applauded author of <i class="opus">Manon Lescaut</i>."
After pointing out the differences in the two books, he
says that they offer the same amount of similarity the
one to the other as do those of Gounod's <i class="opus">Faust</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Boïto's <i class="opus">Mefistofele</i>. "The seeds of Wagnerian reform
have not fallen on barren ground. Puccini reveals
himself in <i class="opus">Manon</i> as a composer gifted with strong
dramatic power, possessing an apparently innate feeling
for stage effect and considerable melodic expression.
His score is exempt from the crudities and vulgarities
from which certain modern Italian operas are not free.
The entire first act is treated with a wonderful lightness
of touch. In the grand duet between Manon and Des
Grieux in the second act, the composer has fully risen
to the height of the situation. His music is full of
melody and passion. It ends in a decidedly Wagnerian
fashion which evokes recollections of <i class="opus">Tristan und Isolde</i>.
We have only singled out a few salient features in a
work that is remarkable from many points of view,
not the least of which is its sincerity of purpose, and
we cordially congratulate the composer upon having
made so successful a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">debut</i> amongst us."</p>

<p>In contrast to the <i class="cite">Times</i> critic, the writer says: "The
inevitable intermezzo separates the second from the
third act. It reproduces some of the motives heard in
the above-named duet, and is extremely effective."</p>

<p>In the <i class="cite">Academy</i> of May 19, 1894, Mr. J.&nbsp;S. Shedlock
writes: "The composer has really something to say,
and has said it to very great, though not the best,
advantage. At present he is too strongly influenced by
Wagner and by others to display his full individuality.
The influence of Wagner is specially marked not so
much in the use of representative themes as in phrases
and melodies which recall <i class="opus">Die Meistersinger</i>, <i class="opus">Tristan</i>, and
<i class="opus">Siegfried</i>. As, for example, the music in the first act,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
when Manon descends from the coach, or the opening
of the intermezzo.... Of the four acts, the second
and fourth appear to us the strongest ... the love
duet between Manon and Des Grieux is a masterpiece
of concentration and gradation, the fine broad phrase
at the close, afterwards heard with imposing effect at
the end of the third act and with tender expression in
the fourth, ought alone to ensure the success of the
work.... Of course, in a modern opera an intermezzo
is indispensable. Puccini, however, gives to his
distinct dramatic meaning: the coda with its orchestration
is original and expressive."</p>

<p>The <i class="cite">Times</i> said of <i class="opus">Manon</i>, on May 15, 1894, that in
melodic structure and general cast of its phraseology
the new work has many points of affinity with the most
popular productions of the young Italian school; but it
is far above these in workmanship, in the reality of its
sentiment, and, above all, in the atmosphere. It
supposes that Puccini is the author of his own book,
and on the whole prefers Massenet's libretto, and points
out that the climax of the piece, musically, if not
dramatically, is the penultimate scene, outside the
prison at Havre. The finale to this scene in which
occur the comments of the crowd on the prisoners,
some of whom are covered with confusion, while others
are jauntily defiant, is hailed as the finest number in
the work. The weakest thing in the opera is, according
to this critic, the intermezzo, but an atonement is made
by the opening of the third act. The work, he concludes,
amply deserved the very enthusiastic reception
it obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Even at this short distance of time it is something
of a curiosity to read that the National Anthem was
sung, under Signor Mancinelli's direction, at the beginning
of the evening by the choristers grouped round a
bust of the Queen.</p>

<span class="subhead">"LA BOHÈME"</span></h2>

<p>The mere fact that <i class="opus">La Bohème</i>, Puccini's fourth work,
to which he gave the plain title of opera, is his most
popular composition for the stage, makes one all the
more inclined to search more minutely for weaknesses.
But with repeated performances (for it has
passed into the regular repertory of all opera houses
wherever it has been played) its unity, both as an idea
and an expression, comes out more and more with
remarkable distinctness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 321px;"><img id="i68" src="images/i101.jpg" width="321" height="483" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">MISS ALICE ESTY AS MIMI IN "LA BOHEME"</div></div>

<p>It captured the Italian ear and taste immediately,
and babies were christened Mimi and Rodolfo just as
ten years before, Santuzza and Turiddu, culled from
Mascagni's <i class="opus">Cavalleria Rusticana</i>, were favourite
baptismal appellations. It did not take long for
England&mdash;represented, in this instance, by the comparatively
limited number of opera-lovers&mdash;to take it
to its heart. It delighted fastidious France and even
satisfied hypercritical and essentially conservative
Germany. Of all Puccini's work, it exhibits perhaps
the most spontaneity, and as a piece of modern music&mdash;if
the melodies themselves, apart from their very
definite piquancy and freshness, do not rise to any vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
heights of emotional expression&mdash;its absolute continuity
is certainly a very high artistic achievement and stands
unquestionably as its most striking feature.</p>

<p>Illica and Giocosa provided the book, and their idea
in providing the framework is clearly indicated by the
prefatory note to the vocal score. They begin with a
quotation from the preface to Murger's <i class="opus">Vie de Bohème</i>,
of which the thoroughly impressionistic opera is a
most spirited musical expression. <i class="opus">The Bohemians</i>,
under which title the opera was first presented in
England, does not express by any means the exact
nature of the work. It is the spirit of Bohemianism&mdash;that
curious almost undefinable quality, which in reality
simply means the absolute living for, and in, the mood
of the moment, and is not by any means the entire
monopoly of the artistic temperament&mdash;that is portrayed
by the dramatic scheme. In the matter of following
Murger's story, which as a novel is the most free in the
whole range of modern literature, the librettists have
been careful to give the spirit rather than the letter.
They even roll two characters, Francine and Mimi, into
one; for they find that although in Murger's book
characters of each person are clearly defined, one and
the same temperament bears different names and is
incarnated, so to speak, in two different persons.
"Who cannot detect," they say, "in the delicate
profile of one woman the personality both of Mimi
and Francine? Who as he reads of Mimi's little hands,
whiter than those of the Goddess of Ease, is not
reminded of Francine's little muff?"</p>

<p>The librettists were content to string together four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
more or less detached scenes from the story. Save
for the death of Mimi at the close, there is no real
climax to any of the four acts. In the first act, the
two chief characters go off and sing their final high
note in the passage; in the third, where they part more
in sorrow than in anger, the situation is varied between
a similar device of finishing the duet "off" or by
quietly sitting up at the back of the scene. These two,
out of many points of subtlety, are mentioned merely
as showing Puccini's mastery in catching the essential
spirit of the dramatic scheme, which is atmospheric, or
purely impressionistic. The supremacy of his art is
shown in a very marked way by the preservation of
the continuity of the idea by the musical expression.
In this <i class="opus">La Bohème</i> stands as a very notable modern
work solely because of its absolute keeping to the idea
which dominates it. Leoncavallo set the same story
to music, writing the book himself. As a mere adaptation
of a novel for stage purposes, the dramatic
portion of this opera, which keeps the stage in
France and Germany, may be pointed to as offering
certain points of superiority. But the music is
certainly not atmospheric nor impressionistic, and the
two works never really come into rivalry. Puccini's
<i class="opus">La Bohème</i> is absolutely on its own plane, and in its
own particular way supreme.</p>

<p><i class="opus">La Bohème</i> was composed partly at Torre del Lago
and partly in a villa which Puccini took for a time at
Castellaccio, near Pescia. It was given for the first
time at the Teatro Regio, Turin, on February 1, 1896,
Toscanini being the conductor, and cast as follows:</p>

<p>Its first appearance in England was interesting from
the rare fact that a new opera should not only be
produced within a year of its production in its native
land, but that an English company should be the first
to present it in our native tongue. With the title <i class="opus">The
Bohemians</i> it was given at Manchester on April 22,
1897, at the Theatre Royal, by the Carl Rosa
Company, conducted by Claude Jacquinet, and cast
as follows:</p>

<p>It was given at Covent Garden in English, in the
October of the same year, with practically the same
cast. Madame Alice Esty, from whom I learnt several
interesting particulars, not only of the production of
the opera, but of the work in general, and some of the
past history of the wonderful organisation which is
still doing such excellent work in keeping alive the
love for opera in English, was the first English
Mimi, although she was born in Boston. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
were many difficulties in the production, and, strange
to say, the part of Mimi was first offered to Mdlle.
Zelie de Lussan, the well-known exponent of the part
of Carmen, not only in English, but in French as well.
The photograph of Mdme. Alice Esty shows her in the
last Act of <i class="opus">La Bohème</i>; and it will be noticed that she
wears, not the customary black gown of the little
seamstress, but one of some pretensions to magnificence.
She followed, she told me, the idea of the
composer, who particularly wished to bring out the
fact that Mimi, after parting with Rodolfo, had formed
an alliance with a rich viscount. This little incident,
it will be remembered, is duly referred to by Musetta
in the text.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 453px;">

    <div class="caption">PUCCINI'S MANUSCRIPT SCORES. FROM THE LAST ACT OF "LA BOHÈME"</div>
</div>

<p>I have also talked with Puccini about this first
English performance of <i class="opus">La Bohème</i>. "I always feel
about past performances," he said, "in the same way
as dead people. Let us say nothing about them but
good. But I shall never forget the shock it was to me
on arriving at the theatre to find the disposition of the
orchestra in a fashion which I have never seen except
at a circus. Out of two boxes at each end the bass
brass on the one side and the drum on the other gave
forth detached blares and pops which really frightened
the life out of me. They did not seem to have anything
to do with the general musical scheme. I heard this
band rehearsal start, and then I saw that the right
idea, simply because of the square-cut idea as to the
tempi on the part of the conductor was absolutely away
from the spirit of the work. I asked the band to take
a rest and then took two rehearsals with the piano<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
myself. It was not long before the artists, all of them
sincerely concerned with the proper interpretation of
my ideas, and myself got into complete accord. I was
very pleased on the whole with the way it eventually
went, and although I did not see the subsequent
London production, Ricordi told me that the Manchester
performance was far more spontaneous."</p>

<p>How wonderfully Puccini is able, by playing a score
of his on the piano and by his eloquent directions as to
interpretation, to convey his subtlest meaning to an
artist, I can speak from actual knowledge. I have
heard him take a singer through a good deal of this
very opera. Under his almost magical hands, a well
learned interpretation is transformed into a genuinely
spontaneous interpretation. Puccini in the present
year of grace, when I told him that I had seen an
important opera revived in the provinces with the same
strange disposal of the orchestra which had caused
him such distress, threw back his head and roared
with laughter, not in the least unkindly. "You are a
delightful people and seriously artistic, but you will
keep on doing such funny things."</p>

<p>For a long time, however, Mdme. Melba, who in
this country has invariably, since her first performance
of the part in Italian here, been seen in the character,
has appeared in the final scene in much the same
plain dress as in the opening Act, the reason, doubtless,
being that Mimi's loneliness and poverty should be
emphasised. Lately, however, Mdme. Melba has reverted
to the original method of dressing the part, and
appears in the last scene in an even more elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
evening gown of pale blue satin, with a cloak, and
dispenses with a hat.</p>

<p><i class="opus">La Bohème</i> was brought to London after its first
production, as we have seen, and was played about
twenty times that season. The Covent Garden production
in Italian was two years later, on June 30,
1899, when Mancinelli conducted, the cast being as
follows:</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the gifted lady who was in
the mind of the Carl Rosa authorities, for their initial
production, as Mimi, was then seen in the particular
part for which her temperament fitted her. By substituting
Caruso as the Rodolfo&mdash;it is one of the very
finest parts of this tenor&mdash;and Scotti as the Marcello,
we have practically the same cast as that with which
this opera at the present time fills Covent Garden;
invariably one of its most brilliant audiences.</p>

<p>In June 1898 Paris saw <i class="opus">La Bohème</i> at the Opera
Comique, for which performance the composer visited
the French Capital, for the first time, to superintend
some of the first rehearsals. It went to America in
the December of the same year, when it was mounted
at the Academy of Music, Philadelphia, and sung in
Italian. Melba was the Mimi, De Lussan the Musetta,
and Pandolfini the Rodolfo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
New York had seen it, in English, at the American
Theatre, in the previous month. This production,
in which the Rodolfo was J.&nbsp;F. Sheehan; the Mimi,
Yvonne de Treville; and the Musetta, Villa Knox, was
by Henry W. Savage's Castle Square Opera Company.
It was given in French at New Orleans in the winter
of 1900 by Barrich's Company. It was first given in
Germany at the Ander Wren Theatre, Vienna, Frances
Saville being the Mimi and Franz Naval the Rodolfo.</p>

<p>Coming to the story, which with the music is by this
time so familiar to opera-goers, the composer, in characteristic
fashion, plunges us at once, without scarcely as
much as a few bars of prelude, into the midst of things.
At the outset the atmosphere is established by the
restless, vivacious, detached and spirited phrase which,
if it hardly ever assumes the proportions, musically
considered, of a leading theme, at least flavours very
strongly the whole musical fabric. It may well be
taken to represent the free unrestrained spirit of the
<span class="smcap">Vie de Bohème</span>. The curtain rises quickly, and we see
an attic, inhabited by the quartet of gay spirits, those
bold adventurers, as Murger calls them, who are
stopped by nothing&mdash;rain or dust, cold or heat. Every
day's existence is a work of genius, a daily problem.
Now abstemious as anchorites, now riding forth on
the most ruinous fancies, not finding enough windows
whence to throw their money. Truly, as Murger puts
it, a gay life yet a terrible one!</p>

<p>Rodolfo, the poet, gazes pensively out of the window,
Marcello, the artist, is painting the passage of the Red
Sea. It is Christmas Eve, and the cold is bitter: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
to keep the stove alight, they burn up a MS.&mdash;a
drama&mdash;of Rodolfo's.</p>

<p>All through this scene of colloquial and snappy
dialogue, the music runs with remarkable movement.
Soon Schaunard the musician comes in. He has been
lucky enough not only to find a job but to get paid for
it; and he tells us it was an Englishman who employed
him. He has bought provisions with the spoil, and
they spread the feast, in true Bohemian fashion, with
a newspaper for table cloth. They begin the meal
with light-hearted merriment, when the landlord
comes in to collect his much overdue rent. That
worthy is amazed to find his tenants can pay it, and
after taking a glass with them, and chatting about his
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amours</i>, the four irresponsibles get rid of him. They
then decide on a visit to the café Momus in the Latin
quarter, and leave Rodolfo behind for a space, as he
has to finish an article for the <i class="cite">Beaver</i>. "Be quick,
then," says Marcello, "and cut the <i class="cite">Beaver's</i> tale short."</p>

<p>As Rodolfo sits at the table to work, a timid knock
is heard at the door, and Mimi, the pretty little seamstress
who occupies a room near the roof, and who is
already in the grip of the fell disease, consumption,
comes in to ask for a light, her candle having been
extinguished by the draught in the passage. She is
evidently worn out by cough, cold and fatigue, and
Rodolfo, after reviving her with a little wine, makes a
remark as to her delicate beauty. Mimi, however, has
not come to chatter or to be flattered, and with thanks,
prettily expressed, she departs for her chamber. Fate,
in the shape of a lost key, sends her back again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
the draught in the passage puts out not only Mimi's
candle, but Rodolfo's as well. While they both search
for the key, Mimi's cold little hand touches that of
Rodolfo, and the latter clasps it; and he then tells her
of his life and aims and prospects in the beautifully
melodious number, <i class="opus">Che gelida manina</i>, which, like so
many of Puccini's themes, seems to grow out of
the reiteration of a single note, swelling out in a
delightful emotional fulness. Mimi tells Rodolfo of
her work, and how she embroiders flowers on rich
stuffs, which make her think of the green fields and
the sweet scents of the country side; how lonely she
is all by herself in her little top attic; how she takes
her frugal supper all alone. The two natures are
quickly brought together, and Mimi is soon in Rodolfo's
arms and has received his first passionate kiss. The
three friends outside now call up to him, and he says
he has three lines to finish, but that he will join them
anon, and that he wants two places kept at the supper
table. With a full confession of her love, Mimi takes
Rodolfo's arm, and their last notes, "My love, my
love," are heard as they descend the staircase.</p>

<p>At the café Momus&mdash;the exterior of which we see
as the curtain rises on the second Act, preceded by a
clever and vivacious phrase given to the trumpets in
the orchestra&mdash;our four brave Bohemians were known
as the Four Musketeers, since they were inseparable.
"Indeed," says Murger, "they always went about
together, played together, dined together, often without
paying the bill, yet always with a beautiful harmony
worthy of the conservatoire orchestra."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
In this scene, which is full of life and movement&mdash;showing
in the treatment of the chorus, formed of
children, people, soldiers, students, work girls, and
gendarmes, that beautifully polished technique in
melodic construction which makes Puccini so strong and
in every way a master musician&mdash;the lively Musetta
comes on the scene. Once more may Murger's own
words fittingly recall her to mind. "Mademoiselle
Musetta was a pretty girl of twenty, very coquettish,
rather ambitious, but without any pretensions to spelling.
Oh, those delightful suppers ... a perpetual
alternative between a blue brougham and an omnibus:
between the Rue Breda and the Latin quarter."</p>

<p>Although the incidents represented appear to
follow consecutively, it is a little strange to find a
sort of <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">al fresco</i> entertainment in progress after the
references to the bitter cold in the preceding Act.
At any rate, whether the dramatist's license be allowed
or not&mdash;and we may easily imagine a flight of time
to have taken place since the happenings in the
opening Act&mdash;the café Momus, in this second Act, is
so full that our quartet of Bohemians, with Musetta
and her elderly admirer, take their supper <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en plein air</i>.
There is little of incident, or progress of events, in
this lively scene. Musetta is reconciled after singing
her delicious song, in slow waltz form, to her Marcello,
and the fatuous old Alcindoro is left to pay the bill of
the whole party. Yet against this, the sense of movement
and gaiety, shown by the ever-moving crowd,
and the incident of the toy-seller Parpignol&mdash;just a
plain slice of life put down on the stage in a truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
modern method&mdash;is beautifully worked out in the
music, and never for an instant does it flag in
vivacity.</p>

<p>Musetta comes into prominence again in the third
Act. Again is the weather intensely cold, and the chill
drear atmosphere is indicated in the music at the
opening by the subtle passage of bare fifths, which is
further remarkable as a purely musical effect from its
connection with the trumpet passage which heralded
the second Act. The scene is a place beyond the toll-gate,
on the Orleans road, at the end of the Rue d'Enfer.
Over a tavern hangs Marcello's picture as a signboard,
with its title altered to the Port of Marseilles,
signifying its adaptation to its environment.</p>

<p>Two scenes of parting dominate the dramatic plan
of this Act, that of Rodolfo and Mimi, and that of
Marcello and Musetta. They are cleverly contrasted.
Very pathetically does Mimi's "addio senza rancor"
come from the depths of her simple little heart, while
the end is foreshadowed by the hacking cough which
frequently chokes her utterances. Musetta is taken to
task by Marcel for flirting, and off she goes after a
strongly dramatic duet, which for characterisation and
force is one of the most distinctive numbers in the
opera; and after her exit, in a fury, Mimi and Rodolfo
appear to agree, indicated by the last phrases of their
tender duet, to continue together, for yet a space, in
the old relations.</p>

<p>In the fourth Act we are back in the attic; and the
quartet of Bohemians are once more struggling with
the problem of keeping body and soul together. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
of them, Rodolfo and Marcel, at any rate, are lonely,
for Mimi has been taken up by a viscount, and
Musetta, dressed in velvet&mdash;through which, as Rudolfo
tells Marcel, she cannot hear her heart beat&mdash;is riding
in a carriage. But with all their troubles they keep a
stout heart and are able to jest over the herring and
rolls which Schaunard and Colline bring in for dinner.
They dance and romp, and play the fool in the lightest
hearted manner until Musetta suddenly breaks in upon
their pretended jollity. The end is reached rapidly.
Mimi has come home to die, and this she does after
an intensely sad, simple and moving scene, stretched,
as they placed her, on Rodolfo's hard little bed.
Infinitely touching is Mimi's reference, in her last
words, to the song which Rodolfo sang in the opening
Act. She begins <i class="opus">Che gelida manina</i> only to break off
in a fit of coughing. Marcello has gone out to fetch
a doctor and Musetta brings a muff to warm the
dying girl's fingers. Mimi's spirit passes away however
before aid can be brought to her, and the pathos
of the situation is intensified by the silence in which
it takes place. It is Schaunard who whispers to
Marcello that she is dead. To Rodolfo's last despairing
cry of "Mimi! Mimi!" as he realises that his loved
one is no more, does the curtain fall.</p>

<p>There is little to point to in the music save its
chief and outstanding feature, its continuity. In
this the whole charm and strength of the work lies.
Orchestrally, the score of <i class="opus">La Bohème</i> is a beautifully
polished one, not so symphonically complete as <i class="opus">Manon</i>
for instance, but essentially individual. For fulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
as a constructional background one may point to the
orchestration of the duet in the first Act; for daintiness
of effect, the use of harmonics on the harp against the
muted strings in Musetta's waltz-song; while many
happy touches are seen all through, such as the xylophone
and muted trumpets at the toy-sellers' entrance
in the café scene; or again, the striking passage in
fifths at the opening of the third Act, given to the
harp and flutes over the 'cellos playing <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tremolo</i>. The
orchestra employed is the usual large modern
orchestra, with a piccolo, glockenspiel and xylophone.
Considerable use is also made of the division of the
'cellos, in many places, into three.</p>

<p>The complete success, notwithstanding certain
difficulties that have been referred to, of the first
performance of the opera in this country, was duly
chronicled in London, on the day following the event,
in <i class="cite">The Times</i>. The notice states that the composer
was called at the end and bowed his acknowledgments,
from which it would appear that he was prevailed
upon at least to appear on the fall of the curtain,
although, by all accounts I have heard from those who
took part in the performance, Puccini adopted the
custom&mdash;followed, if we may believe certain traditions,
by certain notable playwrights&mdash;of wandering up and
down the streets until the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">première</i> was over.</p>

<p>The writer of the notice in question places the work
on a higher level than <i class="opus">Manon</i>, speaks of the highly
dramatic intensity reached by simple means in the
scenes between Mimi and Rodolfo, notices in the
absence of set songs the Wagnerian method of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
continuous melody, and sums it up as a decided
success gained by the beauty of its melody, the
refinement of the music as a whole, the cleverness in
the handling of the themes, and by the absence of clap-trap.
The performance is spoken of as a genuine
triumph, in spite of the leading tenor's hoarseness.</p>

<span class="subhead">"TOSCA"</span></h2>

<p>With his next opera&mdash;for <i class="opus">Tosca</i> is the only one of his
works so entitled by the composer&mdash;Puccini made a
rather curious reversal of the proceedings as compared
with <i class="opus">La Bohème</i>, taking it from an Italian story treated
from the French point of view. From the old world
story of Murger, Puccini turned to a notable example of
modern French stagecraft, in Sardou's drama of <i class="opus">La
Tosca</i>. His librettists again were Giocosa and Illica, and
they provided the composer with a strikingly apt presentation
of the grim story; not one, perhaps, that lends
itself altogether to musical expression, but one which
certainly grips the attention and carries the hearer
along. By <i class="opus">Tosca</i>, Puccini certainly sustained his now
universal popularity made manifest by the preceding
<i class="opus">La Bohème</i>. It was given first at the Costanzi Theatre,
Rome, on January 14, 1900, conducted by Mugnone,
and cast as follows:</p>

<p>In the music of <i class="opus">Tosca</i> Puccini reveals, more powerfully
perhaps than anywhere, that quick instinct of the
theatre which may be called dramatic, or merely a
very clever fitting of music to the mood of the moment.
It is, in fact, very purely melodramatic, the word being
used here not in its accepted sense of the traditional
"tootle-tootle" in the orchestra when the wicked
villain pursues the innocent and sorely tried heroine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
The story is tragic in all conscience, but it hardly
reaches the level of true tragedy, since it is more
horrible than impressive, and lacks that restraint and
poetry which are two necessary qualities. This much
must be said for the operatic version. It is a shade
less revolting, less purely realistic than the drama, and
it undoubtedly provides a splendid acting <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> for the
exponent of the name part; while the lover, and the
villain&mdash;Scarpia, the chief of the police&mdash;are provided
with opportunities, very little behind, in point of vocal
and dramatic effect. One could very well imagine a
production, on prevailing lines set upon elaboration of
detail, in which Puccini's music, or a great deal of it,
was used purely as incidental music. This suggestion,
however, must in no way be taken to mean that as a
whole the music of this opera lacks continuity of
interest or fails to exhibit the close and essential union
between speech and song. There are many pages of
strong and definite lyrical charm, but somehow the
main interest lies in the action which fascinates the
spectator, rather, one feels, against his better&mdash;or more
calm&mdash;judgment. It is, in short, a most moving picture
of love, hate, jealousy, passion and intrigue. These,
after all, form the great bulk of the material for operatic
treatment; and without entering into the question
whether <i class="opus">Tosca</i> is or is not a work for all time, it has
certain very "live" attributes which make it a notable
achievement.</p>

<p>The scene in the first act shows the Attavanti
Chapel in the Church of Saint Andrea della Valle in
Rome. The strenuous, shuddering chords which preface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
the short prelude are representative of the cruel
nature of Scarpia, whose personality dominates the
scene&mdash;more than this, the figure seems to give at once
the atmosphere of stress, and hints at a wealth of
incident which characterises the whole of that which is
to follow.</p>

<p>A man in prison garb, harassed, dishevelled, well-nigh
breathless with fear and haste, comes in and
glances hastily this way and that. This is Angelotti,
a victim of Papal tyranny, who has escaped from the
Castle of S. Angelo; and his entrance, it will be noted,
is also characterised by a theme always associated with
him throughout the work.</p>

<p>On a pillar is an image of the Virgin, and underneath
it a stoup. "My sister wrote to tell me of this spot,"
says Angelotti, as he searches for the key which will
open the chapel and allow him to escape. While he
searches in feverish haste the string of chromatic
chords carries on the idea of his agitation. With yet
another glance to reassure himself that he has not been
followed, he opens the gate in the grille of the chapel
and disappears.</p>

<p>A light tripping figure ushers in the Sacristan, and
it continues for a space while he walks to the daïs, on
which is an easel and a covered picture. He complains
of the bother he has in washing the brushes of the
artist who is painting an altar-piece. He is surprised
not to find Cavaradossi painting. The Angelus rings,
and the Sacristan kneels and continues the prayer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 330px;"><img id="i86" src="images/i125.jpg" width="330" height="231" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">PUCCINI SNOWBALLING IN SICILY</div></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;"><img id="i86a" src="images/i125a.jpg" width="336" height="252" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">PUCCINI WRESTLING AT POMPEII</div></div>

<p>Cavaradossi now comes in, and a broad melodious
phrase is heard as he ascends the daïs and uncovers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
the picture. The Sacristan is amazed to find that it
represents the features of a lady who has been frequently
to pray in the church, and is further shocked
when the artist draws forth a miniature and compares
it with his figure, into whose features he has incorporated
the dusky glow and peach-like bloom of his
beloved Floria. The phrase indicated at Cavaradossi's
entrance now swells out in a lyrical melody in which
he sings that his Madonna's eyes are blue, while
Tosca's are dark as a moonless night, the Sacristan
punctuating the rhapsody with a pious ejaculation to
the effect that the artist scorns the saints and jests with
the ungodly.</p>

<p>After the Sacristan's departure to a snatch of his
characteristic phrase, Angelotti, believing the church
empty, comes out of the chapel. Cavaradossi does not
at first recognise, in this prison-worn creature, his
friend the Consul of the Republic. Tosca's voice is
heard, and the artist makes a sign to Angelotti to remain
yet a little while in hiding, and on hearing that the
fugitive is spent with hunger, he gives him the basket
left, for his refreshment, by the Sacristan.</p>

<p>A quick moving figure, accompanied by triplets,
announces Tosca's entrance, and she thinks that
she has heard her lover conversing with another
woman, and even declares she heard the swish
of skirts. Cavaradossi attempts to embrace her, but
she reproves him, and first makes an offering before the
Virgin's shrine. This done, she tells him that although
she is singing at the theatre that evening, the piece is
a short one, and proceeds to sing in a delightfully suave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
melody, which increases gradually in intensity, of the
delights of love in a quiet secluded cottage far away
from all worldly distractions. Cavaradossi comes in
at the close with an impassioned burst on a characteristic
high note, in which he says that he is caught in
the toils of her enchantment. The artist makes as his
excuse for her quick dismissal the need of continuing
his work on the picture, but his frequent glances
towards the chapel show that his anxiety for his friend
is the cause of his agitation. But Tosca now comes in
sight of the picture, and is struck by the resemblance
of the face to some one she has seen. She immediately
connects the whispering she has heard before arriving
upon the scene and the anxious looks towards the
chapel together as a proof that Cavaradossi has been
meeting the original of the picture. The incident,
however, leads up to a further avowal of devotion on
the part of Cavaradossi, and their voices blend together
for a brief space in a delicious bit of melody. Tosca
elects to be comforted, and with a final thrust she goes
out, requesting her lover to change the lady's eyes to
black ones.</p>

<p>Angelotti now comes out of the chapel and tells of
his plan of escape. Cavaradossi gives him the key
of his villa, and indicates the way he may reach it.
Angelotti takes up the bundle of clothes left by his
sister for his disguise&mdash;the sister being the lady who
has been frequenting the church of late, and who has
attracted the artist's attention&mdash;and goes off, while
his friend tells him, as a final precaution in case of
urgent need, of a passage that leads down to a cellar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Just as Angelotti is going the cannon sound from the
fortress, giving the signal that the prisoner's escape
has been discovered.</p>

<p>On their exit, the Sacristan enters, followed by
choir boys, acolytes and a crowd of people. The
Sacristan tells them the news of Bonaparte's defeat,
that there will be rejoicings and a new cantata for the
occasion sung by Tosca, and his snatch of melody is
cleverly derived from the theme heard on his first
entrance. The choir boys burst out into a great riot
of joyous merrymaking, beginning with "Te Deum"
and "Gloria," and breaking out into "Long live the
King," the Sacristan trying his best to drive them into
the sacristy to vest for the festival service. Their
jollity is cut short by the entrance of Scarpia&mdash;whose
sinister theme breaks in characteristically, as always&mdash;followed
by Spoletta and others of his staff. After
bidding them curtly prepare for the solemn "Te
Deum," he motions the rather frightened Sacristan to
his side, and tells him that a State prisoner has
escaped, and from information received has been
tracked here. He asks which is the Attavanti Chapel,
and the facts that the gate is open and that a new key
is in the lock give at once a clue.</p>

<p>A police agent comes out of the chapel and brings
with him the basket given to Angelotti by Cavaradossi;
and Scarpia, after a little more judicious questioning of
the Sacristan, is able to guess that the fugitive has
been assisted by the painter.</p>

<p>Tosca now comes back, and after signalling to the
Sacristan, Scarpia retires behind a pillar, watching her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
as she looks about for Cavaradossi. To serve his own
ends, he decides to rouse the jealousy of the woman;
and after a little flattery, expressed in a suave, flowing
melody, he brings out a fan and mildly inquires
whether it forms any part of the customary outfit of
a painter. From the coronet on it Tosca recognises
it as belonging to the Marchioness Attavanti, who is
the sister of Angelotti, and a member of the family to
whom the chapel is dedicated. Forgetful of Scarpia's
presence and the place where she is, Tosca, in a
finely emotional passage&mdash;broken into now and again
by Scarpia, who rams home his poisonous suggestions&mdash;bewails
the weakness of her lover; and the wily
Scarpia, after tenderly escorting her to the church
door, despatches an agent to watch her closely. His
exultation at having fired her jealousy is punctuated
twice by the sound of cannon; and into the rather
curious triplet accompaniments is worked the opening
phrases of the organ, which signals the approach of the
procession of the Chapter, with the Cardinal, to whom
Scarpia makes a reverence as he passes him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 327px;"><img id="i90" src="images/i131.jpg" width="327" height="241" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">PUCCINI DESCENDING ETNA ON A MULE</div></div>

<p>"Our help is in the name of the Lord, who hath made
heaven and earth," sing the Chapter and monks, while
Scarpia continues his musings as to the business he
has on hand. From the mere catching of the escaped
prisoners his thoughts turn to lustful possession of
Tosca; and the whole scene, finely contrasted, is worked
up with superb force into one of those magnificently
solid finales which reveal the technic of Puccini so
emphatically. The cannon continue to go off&mdash;the
sound is managed, by the way, by striking a huge cone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
over which is stretched, drum-fashion, a tight skin&mdash;the
whole crowd turn towards the high altar, the stately
"Te Deum" swells through the church, and at the
end, Scarpia, after saying that for Tosca he would
renounce his hopes of heaven, joins in the last phrase:
"All the earth shall worship Thee, the Father everlasting."
The curtain descends quickly to the harsh
progression of chords forming the Scarpia theme.</p>

<p>The second act shows us Scarpia's room in the
Farnese Palace. It is on an upper floor. To the left
a table is laid, and at the back a large window looks
over the courtyard.</p>

<p>Scarpia is at supper, and looks at his watch from
time to time impatiently. "Tosca is a famous
decoy," he sings; "to-morrow's sunrise shall see the
two conspirators hanging side by side on my tallest
gallows." Ringing a handbell, which is answered by
Sciarrone, he inquires whether Tosca is in the Palace,
and learns that she has been summoned thither.
Scarpia orders the window to be thrown open, and
borne on the evening air comes the sound of a gavotte
from the orchestra which is playing in one of the lower
rooms at an entertainment given by Queen Caroline.
Very skilfully is this graceful little melody, just sufficiently
archaic in its mould to be characteristic of the
period, used as a background for the clever dialogue
which follows, from which we learn that Tosca is to be
lured to the Palace in the hope of seeing Cavaradossi.
Spoletta comes in to give an account of his visit to the
villa, and enrages Scarpia by telling him of Angelotti's
escape. The minister is somewhat mollified when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
Spoletta tells him that he promptly secured the painter.
Now, with striking effect, the dance measure gives
place to a cantata, proving that Tosca is in the Palace
in the Queen's apartments. Scarpia's directions as to
securing Cavaradossi are worked into the musical
fabric with consummate effect, and continue as the
painter, now a prisoner, is led in. Cavaradossi breaks
off from his curt and guarded replies to Scarpia's
questioning on hearing Tosca's voice. He denies
strenuously that Angelotti received any aid from him,
and even laughs at his examiner. Scarpia shuts the
window in anger, and the repetition of his characteristic
similar phrase leads up to a strenuous passage in
which determination is skilfully depicted in contrast to
the almost colloquial movement of the preceding
passages. "Once more," says Scarpia, "where is
Angelotti?" and from a remark by Spoletta the application
of the process torture to wring a confession from
the prisoner is hinted at. Tosca now enters, and runs
quickly to her lover, who tells her quickly in an undertone
not to say a word of what she has seen at the
villa. As Scarpia signals to Sciarrone to slide back
the panel which leads to the torture chamber, he says
formally, "Mario Cavaradossi, the judge is wanting to
take your depositions." Sciarrone then gives the
directions to Roberto, an underling, to at first apply
the usual pressure, and to increase it as he will direct
him.</p>

<p>Then follows a highly dramatic scene, ushered in
with a characteristic theme indicating the torture which
Tosca's lover is to undergo, between Scarpia and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Tosca, in which the latter dismisses the fan episode
as a feeble trick to rouse her jealousy. Scarpia, however,
comes very quickly to plain speaking, and tells
Tosca that she had better confess all that she knows
as to the escape of Angelotti if she wishes to spare
Cavaradossi an hour of anguish. Tosca learns with
horror that a fillet of steel, gradually tightening round
the temples, is being applied to Cavaradossi's head, and
on hearing his groan of pain, she relents and bursts
out that she will speak if he is released. But Mario
from within calls on Tosca to be silent, and that he
despises the pain. Scarpia directs further pressure to
be applied. Tosca is allowed to gaze through the open
door, and, distracted by what she sees, signifies her
intention of revealing all she knows. Her mind is
made up when she hears another groan of anguish, and
she tells Scarpia that Angelotti is to be found in the
well in the garden of the villa. Scarpia now orders
Cavaradossi to be brought in. From Scarpia's directions
to Spoletta, the fainting victim, nearly at his
last gasp by what he had endured, learns of Tosca's
treachery, and curses her. This painful scene, finely
worked up as it is in intensity, comes to a climax by
the news brought in by Sciarrone of the victory at
Marengo by Bonaparte. This enrages Scarpia, but he
will at least keep the victim he has in hand; and
Cavaradossi, exulting as he foresees the downfall of
the minister, is borne off. Tosca now turns to Scarpia,
and implores him to save Cavaradossi. Splendidly
dramatic is the closing scene, beginning with Scarpia's
light and airy remark that his little supper was interrupted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
and rising to heights of emotional fulness
when Tosca asks him outright to name his price for
saving her lover's life. Tosca's horrified scream, to a
rising passage of two high notes, when she listens to
Scarpia's lascivious proposals, thoroughly fits the
situation. The drums are used cleverly to indicate
the march of the prisoners to their doom, and the
setting up of the gallows for Cavaradossi, and in
contrast to Scarpia's sinister passages, comes the
broad lyrical and impassioned prayer of Tosca, who
rails at God for having forsaken her in her hour of
need. Scarpia presses his infamous proposals, when
Spoletta returns, and speaking outside brings the
news that Angelotti has poisoned himself rather than
allow himself to be taken. A question as to the
disposal of Cavaradossi brings the climax, and Tosca,
by taking upon herself to give directions as to
this, indicates her consent to Scarpia's wishes. But
this master of deceit will not allow the release to be
managed in any but his own way. He tells Spoletta
that there will be an execution, but it will be a sham
one, as in the case of another prisoner, by name
Palmieri, the guns being loaded with blank cartridge
only, and the victim instructed to fall and feign death.
But Tosca wants more than this on her side of the
bargain. Scarpia must give them both a passport out
of the place, and as he goes to the table to write it
Tosca's eyes catch sight of a knife on the table. In an
instant her mind is made up, and as he returns to give
her the paper, and to clasp her in a feverish embrace,
she plunges the knife into his heart. The death-scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
is perhaps a little prolonged, but seeing that it has
been preceded by the torturing of Cavaradossi, it is at
least logical that Tosca should remind him of the
ghastly torture he inflicted on her loved one. The
intensity of the scene is rounded off by the expressive
phrase on a low monotone of Tosca, "And yesterday
all Rome lay at this man's feet." The action to the
finishing notes of this moving scene follows that of the
play. Tosca searches for the passport, and snatches
it from the fast locking palms of the dead man. With
a shudder she rinses her finger with a serviette dipped
in the carafe, and then puts the candles from the supper
table at the head of the corpse, and taking a crucifix
from the wall, places it on the breast, as the Scarpia
theme in long-drawn chords is played softly by the
orchestra. She goes out quietly as the curtain
falls.</p>

<p>The third act takes place on an open space or
platform within the Castle of S. Angelo. At the back
we see the dome of S. Peter's and the Vatican. The
expressive prelude, and the opening song by a shepherd,
are musically of great interest. It begins with a horn
passage, and at the rise of the curtain it is still night,
and we see the dawn break, and hear the many bells
from the church towers, one of the most striking
sounds of the Eternal city.</p>

<p>The pastoral melody of the shepherd has a plaintive
character, and he sings:</p>

<p class="in0 in25">
Day now is breaking,<br />
The weary world awaking,<br />
Lending new sorrow<br />
And sadness to the morrow.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
And the sheep-bells come in with their jangle as the
shepherd continues, with a suggestion of a love
theme:</p>

<p class="in0 in25">
If you could prize me<br />
To live I might try,<br />
But if you despise me<br />
I may as well die.<br />
</p>

<p>Then the church bells continue the strain, now near,
now afar.</p>

<p>A gaoler enters and looks over the parapet to see if
the soldiers to whom is entrusted the grim task of
execution have arrived. Led by a sergeant, the picket
enters, bringing Cavaradossi. The gaoler, after making
him sign a paper, tells him that he has an hour, and
that a priest is at his disposal. Cavaradossi, after
giving a ring to the gaoler as the price of the favour,
is allowed to write a letter, and sings his beautiful air,
one of the chief lyrical gems of the opera, "E luce van
stelle." It ends emotionally, and the singer bursts into
tears with the thought that never was life so dear to
him as now when he is within sight of death.</p>

<p>Spoletta comes in bringing Tosca, and is amazed
to find that she brings a safe-conduct. Tosca and
Cavaradossi join in a finely expressive duet, in which
the latter learns of her devotion, and how for him she
killed Scarpia. Towards the close the voices are unsupported,
and the whole number has a very characteristic
force and movement.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 503px;"><img id="i96" src="images/i139.jpg" width="503" height="313" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">PUCCINI AT TORRE DEL LAGO IN HIS MOTOR BOAT "BUTTERFLY"</div></div>

<p>The sky has gradually been getting lighter, and the
passage of time is marked by the striking of the hour
of four by the church clock. Then Tosca gives the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
final instructions to the condemned man. "As soon
as they fire, fall down." Cavaradossi, in his joy at his
coming release, is even able to be humorous, and
suggests that he will be acting like Tosca.</p>

<p>Tosca watches the supposed execution from the
parapet. "How well he acts!" she cries, after she has
covered her ears with her hands to shut out the sound
of the shooting, and then sees her lover prostrate on
the ground. Leaning over, she calls to him: "Get
up, Mario, now. Quickly away, Mario, Mario." Then
with a heart-piercing cry she learns that Scarpia has
been false to the end, and that the execution has in
very truth taken place. By this time the news of
Scarpia's death has come out, and Spoletta naturally
fixes on Tosca as the murderess. The soldiers' voices
are heard joining in the hue and cry, and Sciarrone
comes in to seize Tosca. Tosca after thrusting back
Spoletta nearly to the ground, hurls herself from the
parapet. Her last thoughts are of the tyrant who has
so cruelly wronged her, and her last words are: "O
Scarpia, we shall face God together!"</p>

<p>In pure orchestration, Puccini in <i class="opus">Tosca</i> shows an
advance on <i class="opus">La Bohème</i>, in the general symphonic fulness
and in the more extended use of representative
themes. The orchestra employed is the usual large
orchestra of the moderns, and Puccini adds a third
flute, a contrabassoon, a celesta, and for the special
effects in the opening of the third act a set of bells.
There are several places where more work than
hitherto is obtained from the dividing of the strings, but
not in any way like the Strauss method, for example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
of subdividing them into several distinct groups. As
will have been seen during the progress of the story,
the themes stand out as invariably characteristic, and
at the first entrance of Tosca the theme is delightful,
given out by the flute against the plucked strings.
There is excellent work by the wood wind in the impressive
finale of the first act, which is mainly developed
out of the bell theme.</p>

<p>In the pastoral music at the opening of the third act
Puccini uses with characteristic force a passage of
fifths&mdash;one which he is always very fond of employing,
and which, curiously enough, always has the effect of
bringing about the special flavour or atmosphere it is
intended to convey in any one particular place.</p>

<p>In the <i class="cite">Daily Telegraph</i> the critic prefaces his column
notice, which appeared the day after the first production,
with a protest against the conjunction of a pure
and beautiful art&mdash;music&mdash;with the workings of a
humanity that has gone to the devil. But apart from
these considerations, the writer has little but praise for
the singularly lucid libretto.</p>

<p>"The first and all important remark to make concerning
the music," he proceeds, "has to do with its
Italian character. There is very little that can be regarded
as common to it and to the typical German
opera. The pedestal is not on the stage and the statue
in the orchestra. Tosca does not offer us declamation
as a key to symphonic music nor symphonic music as
a key to declamation. The work does not follow the
old operatic lines into matter of detail. All is subordinate
to the changing situations and emotions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
the stage. So far Tosca is modern; for the rest it
presents the characteristics which have always distinguished
Italian opera&mdash;long reaches of tender or
passionate melody, intense climaxes, and a disposition
to proceed everywhere on broad and direct lines to the
desired goal."</p>

<p>The charm of the light music of the first act, the
beautiful soul of Cavaradossi to the picture he has
painted, the piling up of the effects in the finale, the
vigour of the music in the second act, particularly
where Scarpia presses his suit, and the duet of the
lovers at S. Angelo, are the points which call forth
praise, while, on the other hand, this critic finds most
of the music allotted to Angelotti and Scarpia dull.
The notice ends with a tribute to the art of Ternina,
who "acted with the grace and directness of a true
tragedian."</p>

<p>Mr. Arthur Hervey, in the <i class="cite">Morning Post</i>, sets out,
very clearly and characteristically, a plain and straightforward
account of the music and story. The curious
succession of chords at the opening of the prelude, the
suggestion of the amorous nature of Scarpia's character
by the opening notes of the second act, the pleasing
effect of the gavotte heard during Scarpia's monologue,
when he awaits the arrival of his spies, the beautiful
song for Tosca, "Vissi d'arte d'amor," the beauty of
the music in the last act, the ingenuity, finish and
resource of the orchestration as a whole, are points
which are fully expressed by this discerning critic.
With regard to the interpretation, he does not find
Signor Scotti's Scarpia entirely satisfactory, while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
joins in the fullest praise for Ternina's masterly performance
in the name part. It ends, that the opera
was received with every sign of success, and that the
composer, Mancinelli, the conductor, and the exponents
were called many times before the curtain.</p>

<p>The <i class="cite">Times</i> critic makes an interesting comparison at
the outset of his notice, referring to the masterly finale
of the first act: "The scene is one in which Meyerbeer
would have delighted, but it is treated by Puccini with
far greater sincerity than Meyerbeer could ever command,
and with a knowledge of effect at least equal to
his." With regard to the use of representative themes,
the writer finds that the one associated with the passion
of Scarpia&mdash;a phrase with an arpeggio in it, appears to
be derived from the woman's charm in the "Ring."
Referring to the gavotte and cantata at the opening of
the second act, the writer says they are "in excellent
style and belong to the period of the action or a little
before it, as it may be doubted whether the Roman
composers of 1800 were capable of producing so
interesting a piece of solid workmanship as the
cantata, or so graceful and original a composition
as the gavotte."</p>

<span class="subhead">"MADAMA BUTTERFLY"</span></h2>

<p>For his latest opera, <i class="opus">Madama Butterfly</i>, Puccini turned
to the flowery land of Japan for the environment of
a story&mdash;the book being by Illica and Giocosa&mdash;which,
following his invariable custom, he chose himself. The
suggestion appears to have come originally from Mr.
Frank Nielson, who was then the stage manager at
Covent Garden, that Puccini should go and see the
play by Belasco, running at the time at the Duke of
York's Theatre in London. He did so, and was immediately
taken with its possibilities. It may be mentioned
as a tribute to the actors who interpreted this play,
that without knowing any English Puccini was able to
follow the story with perfect ease. He was greatly
struck by Miss Evelyn Millard's performance of the
name part, and her photograph as Butterfly is among
his collection of celebrities at Torre del Lago.</p>

<p>The story is a slight one, and is no more Japanese
than the plot of <i class="opus">La Bohème</i> is French. It is a presentation
of the universal theme of a man's passion,
which is an episode, and a woman's love, which is her
life. A little Japanese girl is wooed and won by an
American naval officer. She, in her trust and devotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
regards herself, after going through some sort of
marriage ceremony, as his lawful wife. He regards
the whole affair as an incident, the mere satisfying of
an animal instinct, and returns, married to an American
wife, to find the girl a mother. The ending is the
usual sad one&mdash;the girl takes her life when her dishonoured
state comes upon her in its full significance.</p>

<p><i class="opus">Madama Butterfly</i> was written for the most part during
Puccini's recovery from his accident; but he had
planned out a good deal of it by the end of 1902 or the
beginning of the next year. He himself about this
time said of the work: "As an opera, it would be in
one act divided by an intermezzo. The theme has a
sentiment, a passion which veritably haunts me. I
have it constantly ringing in my head."</p>

<p>The intermezzo mentioned was Puccini's idea of
treating the very effective and most eloquent silence on
which, it will be remembered, the curtain fell, while
the little Japanese girl with her servant and baby were
keeping their long, long vigil through the night,
awaiting the return of the supposed husband who, after
all, was only a lover, and a poor one at that.</p>

</div>

<p>Puccini was at Rome for a time soon after his complete
recovery from his accident, and took special pains
to get up the local colour for his new work. For this
he invoked the aid of the Japanese ambassadress, and
obtained some actual Japanese melodies from a friend
of hers in Paris. Of music there is no lack in Japan,
but by the Japanese themselves it is never written down.
Like the troubadours of old, the musicians, who are a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
sort of guild, hand the traditional songs and dances on
from father to son.</p>

<p><i class="opus">Madama Butterfly</i> was produced at the Scala, Milan,
on February 17, 1904. Canpanini was the conductor,
and it was cast as follows:</p>

<p>Although Puccini was at the very zenith of his
popularity a strange thing happened with the first
production of this new opera, and the composer went
through a similar experience to that which Wagner had
to suffer when <i class="opus">Tannhäuser</i> was first given in Paris.
The audience simply howled with derision. For the
reason of this it is difficult to account. The storm of
disapproval began after the first few bars of the opening
act. Puccini, very quietly, took matters into his own
hands, and at the end of the performance thanked
the conductor for his trouble and marched off with the
score. The second or any subsequent performance
was therefore an impossibility.</p>

<p>He tells an amusing story of a little incident occasioned
by the fiasco, which, he says, brought him at
least some little consolation, and atoned for much
disillusion. A bookkeeper at Genoa, an ardent admirer
of Puccini, indignant at what he considered the outrageous
treatment&mdash;for it was nothing else&mdash;meted out
to his favourite composer, went to the City Hall to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
register the birth of a daughter. When the clerk
asked the name of the child, he replied, "Butterfly."
"What!" said the official, "do you want to brand
your child for life with the memory of a failure?" But
the father persisted, and so as Butterfly the child was
entered. A little time after this Puccini heard of the
incident, and rather touched with the simple devotion,
asked the father to bring the child to see him. On the
appointed day Puccini looked out of the window and
saw a long stream of people approaching his front
door. Not only did the father bring little "Butterfly,"
but, as in the first act of the opera from which her name
was derived, her mother, sisters, cousins, aunts, uncles,
as well&mdash;in fact the whole surviving members of the
genealogical tree. Puccini laughingly said at the end
of a trying afternoon that it was the most gigantic
reception he had ever held.</p>

<p>The despised opera was given in what is known
as the present revised version at Brescia, on 28 May
of the same year, the Butterfly being Krusceniski, and
Bellati the Sharpless, Zenatello being again the Pinkerton.
Strange to say, it proved entirely to the taste of
those who saw it. The revision, as a matter of fact,
amounted to very little. It was played in two acts
instead of one, with the intermezzo dividing two
scenes in the second act, making it, in reality, in
three acts, and the tenor air was added in the last
scene.</p>

<p>No more striking proof of Puccini's popularity could
be found than the fact that the new opera quickly
came to London. It was seen at Covent Garden on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
July 10, 1905, Campanini being the conductor, and
was cast as follows:</p>

<p>Its splendid performance was helped in no small
degree by the superb interpretation of the name part
by Mdme. Destinn, and the news of its favourable
reception was one of the greatest pleasures ever
afforded to its composer. It was given again early in
the autumn season of the same year, by the company,
conducted by Mugnone (who, by the way, was not the
person of the same name whose death was chronicled
very soon after the conclusion of the season), and for
which the composer came over, having been away at
Buenos Ayres when the work was given in the summer.
Zenatello, who was the original Pinkerton at the Milan
production, was seen in this part on this occasion,
making his first appearance in London during that
season. Giachetti was the Butterfly and Sammarco
the Sharpless.</p>

<p>The original source of the story, I believe, was
a story by John Luther Long, and emanated from
America. It was turned into a play by David
Belasco, and, as in the case of <i class="opus">The Darling of the
Gods</i>, the author's name appeared jointly with the
dramatist, or adaptor, on the play bills. The simple
touching little story depends rather upon its pathos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
and atmosphere, which is decidedly poetical, than on
any great dramatic situation. A lieutenant, F.&nbsp;B.
Pinkerton, of the United States Navy, goes through
a ceremony of marriage with a little Japanese girl,
with no intention of regarding the contract as in the
least degree binding. Little Butterfly (or Cio Cio San,
as her Japanese name is) thinks differently, and after
her child is born watches and waits anxiously for the
return of her husband. Sharpless is a friend of
Pinkerton's, and is the consul at Nagasaki, and he
tries to break the news gently to the sorrowful girl
who has been so cruelly misled, and in the "letter" song
in the last act is provided with one of the most subtle
and dramatic numbers in the whole work. Butterfly
believes in Pinkerton's fidelity and honour up to the
end, when her ideal is shattered by the arrival of
Pinkerton's wife, an American woman, who wants to
befriend the child, and who has apparently condoned
Pinkerton's lapse from the strict path of virtue.
Butterfly, however, prefers to die by her own hand,
and this she does, after caressing the child and giving
way to a torrent of grief, and pathetically placing an
American flag in the baby's hand. Pinkerton comes
in time to see her pass away, and in calling her name
in an outburst of sorrow and remorse, the story ends.</p>

<p>In <i class="opus">La Bohème</i> it has been seen how singularly
happy Puccini was in stringing together, by the flow
of his music, a dramatic scheme that is concerned
with detached scenes and incidents; and in <i class="opus">Madama
Butterfly</i> he is equally successful and characteristic.
The music is essentially vocal, but the chief melodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
are often to be found in the orchestral fabric, a feature
which comes out more prominently in this work than in
any of this composer's since <i class="opus">Manon</i>, and which goes to
prove that it stands as his chief orchestral achievement.</p>

<p>The present work begins in somewhat curious
fashion with a tonal fugue, as if to show that the
composer with all his modernity has still a regard for
the old forms. A similar figure is used for the opening
of the second act. The first indication of the Japanese
character in the music&mdash;and this flavour is very
sparingly introduced&mdash;comes when Goro (a sort of
marriage broker) parades his wares, in the shape of
girls, before the lieutenant. There is here a very
distinctive melody in octaves underneath the vocal
part, which is most effective. Several of the little
melodies make an entrance after their first quotation
much after the fashion of the old <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">ritornello</i>, which is an
interesting point, among several, to note in Puccini's
working out, on quite modern lines, of his scheme.
The themes are often altered, in place of development,
by a change in the time; and at the opening of the
first act several examples are to be found, while here
and there an Eastern character is given to the music
by the frequent use of the flat seventh. Another
noteworthy feature is the constant modulation by
means of chords of the seventh.</p>

<p>Sharpless, the friend (a baritone), makes an entry
with a fine burst of melody&mdash;the theme, easily recognised
on hearing the work, which is associated with
this character, being one particular rhythmic distinction&mdash;and
when Pinkerton (the tenor) explains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
that he has bought the house, and probably the
little lady with it, on an elastic contract, there is a
clever counterpoint in the music to the introductory
fugue. Pinkerton's first chief solo&mdash;the music, of
course, runs on continuously from start to finish&mdash;is
a broad and vocal aria, quite allied to the old form.
The general trend of the music gets brisker at the
entry of Butterfly and her girl friends. Butterfly's
first song, a beautiful "largo," in which she tells of
her approaching happy state, is skilfully blended with
the sopranos of the chorus, and ends with a high D flat
for the soloist. The procession and arrival of Butterfly's
relations give an opportunity for some humour in
the music, which is quaint and characteristic, and
brings in a clever theme for the bassoons. Just before
the signing of the contract, Butterfly has a pathetic air,
in which she states that, fully believing in Pinkerton,
she has embraced the Christian religion and discards
her native gods. Soon after, a noisy and cantankerous
old uncle of the bride comes in to protest against the
union. Here is another of the few examples of
Japanese music, and his entry is shown by a quaint
march of the conventional pattern chiefly in unison.
After the guests leave, Butterfly and Pinkerton have a
very tender scene, and begin a duet of great charm.
Butterfly's share continues rather more vigorously when
she is preparing for the marriage chamber, while Pinkerton
has a contemplative air as he admires her pretty
movements. The act ends with a strenuous outburst of
love and longing, both voices going up to a high C sharp
by way of a finish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
The second act is in Butterfly's little house, and is
divided into two sections without a change of scene,
the curtain being lowered merely to mark the passage
of time. Butterfly and her faithful maid Suzuki begin
to feel the pinch of poverty, and the desertion of Pinkerton
is soon realised, although Butterfly will not
believe it. Butterfly has a characteristic air, vocal but
possibly commonplace, and quite typical of "Young
Italy," in which she explains that Pinkerton will come
back, how she will see the smoke of his vessel, and
watch him climbing the hill from the harbour. Sharpless
then comes in to try and break the news, and
brings in a former native lover, a Prince, Yamadori,
who is evidently quite willing to accept Butterfly as his
spouse and make her happy. But she simply bids
Sharpless to write and tell his friend Pinkerton that
Butterfly and Pinkerton's son await the coming of their
lord and master. The first scene ends with Butterfly,
the maid, and the child sitting up all the night to watch
for the arrival of Pinkerton's vessel. She dresses
herself in her wedding garments, and decorates the
little house with flowers. The maid and the child soon
fall asleep, but as the moonlight floods the scene
Butterfly remains rigid and motionless. A delicate
instrumental passage in the music gives the idea
of the vigil, in the nature of an intermezzo, and a
fresh and pleasing effect is obtained by the use of a
humming with closed lips, by the chorus outside, of the
melody, supported by the somewhat unusual instrument,
a viol d'amore. It is a curious instance, and probably
the first, of the use of this "bouche fermée" effect as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
an integral part of the orchestration. For a special
effect, Puccini also adds to his score in another place
the Hungarian instrument, a czimbalom, added to the
dulcimer.</p>

<p>The second scene has a rich, picturesque, and gay
opening, the voices of the sailors and the bustle of the
vessel's arrival being well shown in the bright music.
The end of the tragedy is near, and is very pathetic.
Pinkerton is full of remorse, and his wife Kate tries to
console Butterfly, but the little Japanese girl, with her
heart broken when she learns that Pinkerton has passed
out of her life, decides to kill herself. She bandages
the child's eyes, commits the deed behind a screen, and
then staggers forward to die with her arms about the
child. With Butterfly's farewell to the child the work
ends, as Pinkerton and Sharpless come in to see her
die. The music ends with a curious outburst of
Japanese character almost in the nature of an epilogue,
and oddly enough it ends on a chord of the sixth in
place of the accustomed tonic.</p>

<p>All through the music is fresh and interesting, and,
provided that by the setting and general interpretation
the necessary picturesque atmosphere is established,
the opera proves singularly attractive. From the nature
of the story, the text reads extremely well in English;
in fact, contrary to usual custom, much of the dialogue
is strange in Italian, in which mellifluous tongue there
is no equivalent apparently for "whisky punch" or
"America for ever!"</p>

<p>With this last opera of Puccini we come to the end
of the chapter, and with it, he may fittingly be left to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
the verdict of those who shall come after. At the time
of writing no one can say with what the gifted melodist
will follow it&mdash;whether one of the few themes which
have been mentioned as being in his mind will materialise,
or whether the "Notre Dame" of Victor Hugo,
or a certain play of Maxim Gorky's will eventually
come to an achievement. Certain it is, that the present
success of <i class="opus">Madama Butterfly</i>, with all its progress on
the purely orchestral side, cannot fail to call attention
to the earlier works, particularly <i class="opus">Le Villi</i>, <i class="opus">Edgar</i> and
<i class="opus">Manon</i>, as being compositions of singular sincerity.</p>

<p>One of Mr. E.&nbsp;A. Baughan's most interesting pieces
of criticism, I think, was that written in the <i class="cite">Outlook</i> of
July 15, 1905, after the first production of <i class="opus">Madama
Butterfly</i> in England. After making comparison between
Puccini and other modern Italians on the subject
of musical expression of a theme, in general, he deals,
in characteristic fashion, with the dramatic structure
of the opera in question.</p>

<p>"The story itself, as arranged by the Italian librettists,
has also grave defects as the subject of an opera.
The character of Madame Butterfly herself, with her
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">naïve</i> love for the American naval officer, her belief
that she is a real American bride and that he will
return to lift her once more into the paradise from
which she was so cruelly cast out by his departure,
and, when the truth of her "marriage" is at last
revealed, her tragic recourse to the honourable dagger
is a fit subject for music. The emotions to be
expressed are mainly lyrical. The other characters
are outside musical treatment. F.&nbsp;B. Pinkerton, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
American naval officer, is never possessed of any
lyrical emotion, except when he expresses his remorse
for the consequences of his misdeeds; Sharpless, the
American consul, who acts as a go-between, feels
nothing but a vague disquietude, which is easily
drowned in a whisky-and-soda, and later a rather
tender pity for Butterfly; Goro, the marriage-broker,
is antipathetic to music; Mrs. Pinkerton is the merest
of shadows; and of all the cast the only characters
that have thoughts or feelings which can be interpreted
by music are Butterfly's faithful maid, Suzuki,
and her uncle Bonzo, who objects on religious grounds
to Butterfly's marriage. Puccini has written a love-duet
for the American naval officer and Madame
Butterfly, but as he can make no pretence to any
more passionate feeling than a passing sensualism
there is a want of emotional grip in the scene. Then
the Japanese environment of the story does not help
the composer. Madame Butterfly is only Japanese by
fits and starts. When she is emotional she is a native
of modern Italy, the Italy of Mascagni, Leoncavallo
and Puccini himself. It could not be otherwise, for
there is no musical local colour to be imitated which
would serve in passionate scenes.</p>

  <div class="caption">PUCCINI'S MANUSCRIPT SCORES, FROM THE FIRST ACT OF "MADAMA BUTTERFLY"</div>
</div>

<p>"The composer has overcome many of these difficulties
with much cleverness. When the stage itself is
not musically inspiring, he falls back on his orchestra
with the happiest effect. The prosaicness of the
European lover and his friend the Consul and the
sordid ideas of the Japanese crowd are covered up
by a clever musical <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ensemble</i>, and the whole drama<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
is drawn together by Puccini's sense of atmosphere....
Madame Butterfly herself is a musical creation.
The composer could not, of course, make her Japanese,
but very poetically he has made her musically <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">naïve</i>
and sincere. She is a fascinating figure from the
moment when she appears singing of her happiness in
having been honoured by the American's choice. Her
share in the love duet is also well conceived. It
is not exactly passionate music; rather ecstatic and
sensitive. And the gradual smirching of this butterfly's
brightness until in the end she becomes a wan
little figure of tragedy is subtly expressed in the music.
It is not deep music&mdash;indeed it should not be&mdash;but it
has all the more effect because it is thoroughly in
character. Even when Madame Butterfly sets her
child on the ground and addresses to him her last
worship before dying with honour she is not made to
rant by the composer. A German would not have
forgotten Isolde's Liebestod; a Mascagni would have
remembered his own Santuzza; a Verdi would have
metamorphosed the Geisha into an Aïda; but Puccini
has kept to his conception of the character and she is
never once allowed to express herself on the heroic
scale."</p>

<p><i class="opus">Madama Butterfly</i> is published (like all the operatic
works of Puccini) by Ricordi, who, with the vocal
score (the English translation being by R.&nbsp;H. Elkin),
departed from the usual style of binding and issued it
in a very decorative "Japanesy" cover of white linen,
with all sorts of tasteful little designs&mdash;butterflies and
flowers&mdash;jotted about on the cover and on the margins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
My final paragraph may well be an expression of
thanks to those who have been kind enough to assist
me with the preparation of my little book. First of
all I would thank Signor Puccini, who has cheerfully
submitted to two things which he cordially detests&mdash;sitting
for his photograph on two special occasions
and answering letters. Again would I thank him for
the time he was good enough to spare me when I had
the pleasure of meeting him in London during his last
two visits. Then to Messrs. Ricordi, who not only
have been at considerable pains to verify casts, first
performances and biographical details, but have generously
enriched my library of opera scores by those
Puccini works which I did not possess. Yet again, to
Mr. C. Pavone, their representative in London, for considerable
assistance most cheerfully rendered; and to
my friends Mrs. John Chartres&mdash;for helping out my
very limited knowledge of Italian, and Mr. Percy Pitt&mdash;for
allowing me to see his orchestral scores of the
Puccini operas.</p>

<p>"A very acceptable volume."&mdash;<i class="cite">Rapid Review.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Newman gives a clear and critical synopsis of the magnificent series
of operas, and indicates very simply the leading themes in each. The volume
is neither too precise nor too extravagant in its appreciation; it has a quality
of sanity which such work often lacks."&mdash;<i class="cite">T.&nbsp;P.'s Weekly.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dr. Walker has achieved a difficult task with complete success. The
review of Beethoven's music as a whole is finely critical, and the appreciation
is expressed with force and fluency; while a short and judiciously described
bibliography and a list of the master's music complete this newest volume in a
scheme which bids fair to develop into a collection of thoroughly original and
excellent monographs, which will be for the average amateur (and not a few
professionals) uniformly more useful than many an encyclopædia or dictionary."&mdash;<i class="cite">Evening
